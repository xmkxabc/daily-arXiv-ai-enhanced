To address this, we\nintroduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,\ntraining-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack\ntechniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively\ninjecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our\nexperiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful\nresponse rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four\nbenchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by\nRAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general\ncapabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC.

Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these\ncodes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a\nfundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment\nin communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural\npolar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off\nby simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER\ncharacteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough\nthrough three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture\nthat leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex\ndependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly\noptimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an\nadaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code\n(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for\nrobust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code\nconfiguration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and\nBLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and\nDeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved\narchitecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further\namplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error\nrate metrics over existing approaches.

Our weakly\nsupervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images\ninto the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.\nTo generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly\nrandomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary\ndataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and\nanatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,\nusing both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS\ndataset.

We\ninterpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to\nuse a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.\nThis novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both\nthe model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also\nincorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.\nTo perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data\nmodalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a\nnovel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt\noptimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey\nmodification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively\non closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields\nimprovements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on\na range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a\nviable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into\nthe era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based\nsystems.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10060v1"}

However, the power\nconsumption of conventional IRSs cannot be ignored due to the large number of\nreflecting elements and control circuits. To balance performance and power\nconsumption, we previously proposed a heterogeneous-IRS (HE-IRS), a green IRS\nstructure integrating dynamically tunable elements (DTEs) and statically\ntunable elements (STEs). Compared to conventional IRSs with only DTEs, the\nunique DTE-STE integrated structure introduces new challenges in both channel\nestimation and beamforming. In this paper, we investigate the channel\nestimation and beamforming problems in HE-IRS-assisted multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output systems. Unlike the overall cascaded channel\nestimated in conventional IRSs, we show that the HE-IRS channel to be estimated\nis decomposed into a DTE-based cascaded channel and an STE-based equivalent\nchannel. Leveraging it along with the inherent sparsity of DTE- and STE-based\nchannels and manifold optimization, we propose an efficient channel estimation\nscheme. To address the rank mismatch problem in the imperfect channel sparsity\ninformation, a robust rank selection rule is developed. For beamforming, we\npropose an offline algorithm to optimize the STE phase shifts for wide beam\ncoverage, and an online algorithm to optimize the BS precoder and the DTE phase\nshifts using the estimated HE-IRS channel. Simulation results show that the\nHE-IRS requires less pilot overhead than conventional IRSs with the same number\nof elements.

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level\nprosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions\n(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker\ndisplacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for\nprosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower\nand more context sensitive correlations.

However, this independence ignores critical\ncomparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and\nsuboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of\npointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key\ninnovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise\nRanking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between\neach candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.\nWe strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of\npseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by\ncapturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive\nrelevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise\nmethods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a\ntraining-free manner (PAGC).

Continuous monitoring of the functional safety and\nreliability of automotive radars is a crucial requirement to prevent accidents\nand increase road safety. One of the most critical aspects to monitor in this\ncontext is radar channel imbalances, as they are a key parameter regarding the\nreliability of the radar. These imbalances may originate from several parameter\nvariations or hardware fatigues, e.g., a solder ball break (SBB), and may\naffect some radar processing steps, such as the angle of arrival estimation.

The proposed method exploits a normalized least mean\nsquares (NLMS) algorithm as a block in the processing chain of the radar to\nestimate the channel imbalances. The input of this block is the detected\ntargets in the range-Doppler map of the radar on the road without any prior\nknowledge on the angular parameters of the targets.

Agostino", "Quan Le Thien", "Molly Apsel", "Denizhan Pak", "Elina Lesyk", "Ashabari Majumdar"], "summary": "Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language\nthat extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of\npotential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in\ncomplexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical\nfrequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily\nlossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can\nprovide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic\nmeaning in context.", "comment": "12 pages, 2 figures, accepted submission to Quantum AI and NLP 2025", "cate": "cs.CL", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077v1"}

We present a benchmark for evaluating\nLLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal\nsoundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments\nshow that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,\nbut planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains\nchallenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex\nreasoning.

Both algorithms are rooted in the Alternating Steepest\nDescent (ASD) method for matrix completion, first proposed in [J. Tanner and K.\nWei, Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal., 40 (2016), pp. 417-429]. In deriving the new\nmethods we target the X-ray spectromicroscopy undersampling problem, whereby\ndata are collected by scanning a specimen on a rectangular viewpoint with X-ray\nbeams of different energies. The recorded absorptions coefficients of the mixed\nspecimen materials are naturally stored in a third-order tensor, with spatial\nhorizontal and vertical axes, and an energy axis. To speed the X-ray\nspectromicroscopy measurement process up, only a fraction of tubes from (a\nreshaped version of) this tensor are fully scanned, leading to a tensor\ncompletion problem. In this framework we can apply any transform (such as the\nFourier transform) to the tensor tube by tube, providing a natural way to work\nwith the $\\star_{M}$-tensor algebra, and propose: (1) a tensor completion\nalgorithm that is essentially ASD reformulated in the $\\star_{M}$-induced\nmetric space and (2) a tensor completion algorithm that solves a set of\n(readily parallelizable) independent matrix completion problems for the frontal\nslices of the transformed tensor.

However,\nthe increasing complexity of these frameworks brings non-trivial software bugs,\nwhich may degrade training performance, cause unexpected failures, and result\nin significant resource waste. Understanding framework bugs' characteristics is\nfundamental for quality assurance, allowing the design of more effective\ndebugging and repair methods. Thus, our paper conducts the first large-scale\nempirical analysis of 308 fixed bugs across three popular distributed\ntraining/inference frameworks: DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and Colossal-AI. We\nexamine bug symptoms, root causes, bug identification and fixing efforts, and\ncommon low-effort fixing strategies. Additionally, the distributed nature of\nthese frameworks introduces unique bug root causes, such as allocation strategy\nerror and distributed communication error. Diagnosing and fixing complex bugs\nremains challenging due to factors like the disconnect between symptoms and\nroot causes, high bug reproduction costs, and low-level or cross-component\ninteractions. Interestingly, we observe that 48% of bug fixes require minimal\ncode changes (<=10 LOC) and follow simple strategies such as conditional logic\noptimization, parameter handling enhancement, or version compatibility\nhandling, indicating potential for automation.

Traditionally, Field Operational Testing (FOT) has been\npivotal for macroscopic safety validation of automotive driving functions up to\nSAE automation level 2.

Even at lower automation levels, this\nlimitation - coupled with the substantial costs associated with FOT - motivates\nthe exploration of approaches to enhance the efficiency of FOT-based\nmacroscopic safety validation. Therefore, this publication systematically\nidentifies and evaluates state-of-the-art Reduction Approaches (RAs) for FOT,\nincluding novel methods reported in the literature. Based on an analysis of ISO\n21448, two models are derived: a generic model capturing the argumentation\ncomponents of the standard, and a base model, exemplarily applied to Automatic\nEmergency Braking (AEB) systems, establishing a baseline for the real-world\ndriving requirement for a Quantitative Safety Validation of Residual Risk\n(QSVRR).

The architecture incorporates a single or multiple\nradio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase\nprofiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller\nencompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and\nconsequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel\nchannel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal\ntraining pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable\nabsorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its\nsignal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly\nused by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase\nconfiguration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the\nentire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank\nproperties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for\ncommunication systems at the FR3 band and above.

The proposed\nresults have been proved exploiting the regularization and approximation\nproperties of certain Steklov integrals introduced by Sendov and Popov in 1983,\nand differ from the ones given by Kolomoitsev and Lomako. In addition, the\nproof of the original KL approximation theorems were strictly related to the\napplication of certain classical results of the trigonometric best\napproximation, and thus, they are applicable only for operators of the\ntrigonometric type. By the definition of semi-discrete moduli of smoothness\nhere proposed, we are able to deduce applications also for operators that are\nnot necessarily of the trigonometric type, and can also be used to derive\nsharper estimates than those that can be achieved by the classical averaged\nmoduli of smoothness ($\\tau$-moduli). Furthermore, a Rathore-type theorem is\nestablished, and a new notion of K-functional is also introduced showing its\nequivalence with the semi-discrete modulus of smoothness and its realization.\nOne-sided estimates of approximation can be established for classical operators\non bounded domains, such as the Bernstein polynomials. In the case of\napproximation operators on the whole real line, one-sided estimates can be\nachieved, e.g., for the Shannon sampling (cardinal) series, as well as for the\nso-called generalized sampling operators.

The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision.

In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of\ntemporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally\nrelated states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the\nout-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,\nencouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should\nfacilitate combinatorial generalization.

Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

Our findings show that under certain\nconditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,\nsuch as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling\ntemperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous\nmethods for eliciting human-like priors.

Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to\nthe semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract\ncues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the\nphysical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional\nguidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse\ndance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired\nmusic and dance data, which restricts the model\\^a\\u{A}\\'Zs ability to learn\ndiverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language\nModel (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a\nchoreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,\nhigh-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit\nlearning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both\nmore diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of\nthree components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that\nproduces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a\nmulti-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,\nand textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based\nmotion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which\nensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.\nExtensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "comment": "check demos at https://dancechat.github.io/anon/", "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10574v1"}

Unlike prior methods\nthat rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading\narchitectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can\ndramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically\ndiverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label\nrefinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies\nby identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This\ncomponent specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an\ninitial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an\nadaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial\nfor mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,\nallowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a\nhandful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse\ndatasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,\nand Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and\nadaptability.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CL", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292v1"}

While the\nproblem is hard to approximate in general, there are good approximation\nalgorithms known for several sparse graph families. In this paper, we consider\ndeterministic distributed CONGEST algorithms for the weighted version of the\nproblem in trees and graphs of bounded arboricity.\n  For trees, we prove that the task of deterministically computing a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-approximate solution to the maximum weight independent set\n(MWIS) problem has a tight $\\Theta(\\log^*(n) / \\epsilon)$ complexity. The lower\nbound already holds on unweighted oriented paths. On the upper bound side, we\nshow that the bound can be achieved even in unrooted trees.\n  For graphs $G=(V,E)$ of arboricity $\\beta>1$, we give two algorithms. If the\nsum of all node weights is $w(V)$, we show that for any $\\epsilon>0$, an\nindependent set of weight at least $(1-\\epsilon)\\cdot \\frac{w(V)}{4\\beta}$ can\nbe computed in $O(\\log^2(\\beta/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon + \\log^* n)$ rounds.

To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on\nvision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban\nstreetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and\ndata-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are\nas follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban\nstreetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and\nregions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based\nframework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation\nand comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show\nthat Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).\nHigh Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective\nevaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic\ndifferences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and\ninterpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for\nfuture design.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10342v1"}

While function spaces are\ntypically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced\nthrough applications in computer vision and natural language processing that\nfocus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations.

Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),\nresearchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.\nNevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,\nsuch as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.\nIn this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that\nharnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via\nreinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving\naccuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of\ndecompiled code: \\textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.\nCentral to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system\nto score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,\nD-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher\nscores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,\nD-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler\nand symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then\nevaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with\nthe original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for\nfine-tuning.

To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a\nPyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine\nlearning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior\nwork focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned\noptimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks.

Current\nresearch on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in\nfully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability\nof the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping\nthe image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image\ninto blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various\ntransformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input\ndiversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting\nintermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the\namplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial\nexamples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the\nauxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the\ntrue class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by\nthe proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on\ntwo public HSI datasets.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve\nthe synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera\npositions based on the object's geometry.

In this paper, we offer a new perspective on\nachieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established\ntechniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints\npenalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained\nRL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable\nactions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.\nFurthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through\npenalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely\nby an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This\nreformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving\nresilience to disturbances.

We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),\nby relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially\nnon-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization\nunifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)\nand linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new\nmodels with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per\ntoken and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such\nmodels on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic\ntasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find\nthat PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while\nmatching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases\nexhibiting better length generalization than either.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10918v1"}

We\nconceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to\nproficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual\nqueries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural\ndesign choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information.

Quantization is a key\ntechnique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video\nmatting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal\ncoherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general\nPTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages\ntemporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing\nthe model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and\nultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit\nquantization.

This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme\nfor digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political\nscience researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to\ntest the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the\ninternet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and\nStormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected\nposts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are\nlabeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we\nfine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models\n(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist\ndiscourse.

However, ensuring adequate\ndiversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a\nchallenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the\ndiversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion\nacross semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for\ndiversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on\nsimilar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the\nentropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance\non the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in\nlarge-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case\nof Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and\ngradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy\nmeasures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for\ndiversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on\ndifferent prompts.

These methods assume that a model trained on normal\ndata cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this\nassumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or\naccurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for\nanomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly\nsupervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images\ninto the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.\nTo generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly\nrandomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary\ndataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and\nanatomically coherent.

The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints.

Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures.

We therefore propose adding an external monitor\nthat observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study\nof monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse\ndataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic\ntasks.

However, the spurious rewards that work\nfor Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or\nOLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual\ncode execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes\nsignificantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with\nspurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward\nsignal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned\nduring pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future\nwork. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on\ndiverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy\nto get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely\nspurious reward signals.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.AI", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10947v1"}

Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)\nloss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when\nusing the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy\nLV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the\nlog-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward\nprocesses, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when\ndiffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for\ndiffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that\ncan be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our\nanalysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick\n(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently\noutperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion\nbridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD\nloss achieve better performance.

Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for\nautoregressive generation.

To address this, we\npropose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,\nwhich realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.\nSpecifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with\nNested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency\ncomponents. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels\nof detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token\nefficiency without bells and whistles.

Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit\nsolution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the\nsampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data\ndistribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a\nspecific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses\nregions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength\n$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.\nNotably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We\nalso show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation\n($\\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for\nboth $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in\nshaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the\nsampling trajectory.
