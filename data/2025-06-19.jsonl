ISAC designs\nfacilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.\nSuch applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication\n(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive\ntargets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability\nconstraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of\nURLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station\n(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is\ndeployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS\nregularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to\nthe UE.

To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper\ncoding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and\nsensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for\nhandling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive\ninterference cancellation.

These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or\nanalyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic\nindices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,\ne.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,\nanthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is\nrequired to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small\ndatasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce\naudio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review\nimpractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio\n(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic\ndata, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the\nU.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls\n(Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins\n2022; Ruff et al. 2020).

However, it requires manual construction of drift\nfunctions to bound hitting time for each specific algorithm and problem. To\naddress this limitation, general linear drift functions were introduced for\nelitist evolutionary algorithms. But calculating linear bound coefficients\neffectively remains a problem. This paper proposes a new method called drift\nanalysis of hitting probability to compute these coefficients. Each coefficient\nis interpreted as a bound on the hitting probability of a fitness level,\ntransforming the task of estimating hitting time into estimating hitting\nprobability. A novel drift analysis method is then developed to estimate\nhitting probability, where paths are introduced to handle multimodal fitness\nlandscapes. Explicit expressions are constructed to compute hitting\nprobability, significantly simplifying the estimation process. One advantage of\nthe proposed method is its ability to estimate both the lower and upper bounds\nof hitting time and to compare the performance of two algorithms in terms of\nhitting time. To demonstrate this application, two algorithms for the knapsack\nproblem, each incorporating feasibility rules and greedy repair respectively,\nare compared.

We\nbuilt FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and\nfine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)\nand survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).\n  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on\n749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of\ncancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)\nand independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively.

To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution\nas well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning\nmethodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and\nonflow speed.

Existing distributed aggregative optimization\napproaches typically require access to accurate gradients of the objective\nfunctions, which, however, are often hard to obtain in real-world applications.\nFor example, in machine learning, gradients are commonly contaminated by two\nmain sources of noise: the randomness inherent in sampled data, and the\nadditional variability introduced by mini-batch computations. In addition to\nthe issue of relying on accurate gradients, existing distributed aggregative\noptimization approaches require agents to share explicit information, which\ncould breach the privacy of participating agents. We propose an algorithm that\ncan solve both problems with existing distributed aggregative optimization\napproaches: not only can the proposed algorithm guarantee mean-square\nconvergence to an exact optimal solution when the gradients are subject to\nnoise, it also simultaneously ensures rigorous differential privacy, with the\ncumulative privacy budget guaranteed to be finite even when the number of\niterations tends to infinity.

Recent works have explored the capability of\nout-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless\nchannels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user\nsystems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense\ncell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing\noverhead and high latency in data exchange.

The goal is to allocate items to one of the adjacent agents\nwhile satisfying the EFX condition.\n  Building on the work of Zeng and Mehta'24, which established a sharp\ncomplexity threshold based on the structure of the underlying graph --\npolynomial-time solvability for bipartite graphs and NP-hardness for graphs\nwith chromatic number at least three -- we further explore the algorithmic\nlandscape of EFX-orientation using parameterized graph algorithms.\n  Specifically, we show that bipartiteness is a surprisingly stringent\ncondition for tractability: EFX orientation is NP-complete even when the\nvaluations are symmetric, binary and the graph is at most two edge-removals\naway from being bipartite.

To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the\nfirst dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,\ntemporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich\nannotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver\nan interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,\ntemporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach\nfundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box\ndecision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate\nthat a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced\nwith chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a\nvariety of generators and generation modes.

Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the\nobjective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's\ntopology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both\nitem attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep\nwarehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network\narchitecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer\nmodel. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into\nembeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these\nembeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong\ngeneralization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage\nsystems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including\ncomparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nneural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in\noptimizing retrieval tardiness.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14787v1"}

To address this, South Korea has decided\nto deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary\nPNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing\ninformation, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications,\nfinancial systems, and power distribution.

To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a\ndata-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic\nselection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3)\nevaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean\nopinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance.\nFurthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a\nclosed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data\ncleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model.

Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by\nallowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the\noriginal information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,\nparticularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose\nan HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images\ninto latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational\nburden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions\nwith lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in\ncompliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of\neight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and\ncomputational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which\nis known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method\nwas tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks\nusing vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and\nintroduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,\nour approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images", "comment": "11 pages, 5 figures", "cate": "eess.IV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15258v1"}

One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering\naudio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent\nadvances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of\nhigh-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance.\nHowever, the effect of source separation has not been systematically\ninvestigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work\nexamines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a\nstate-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on\noriginal audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and\nlong-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation\nmethod that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For\nlong-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity\ndetector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction\nin WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm.

To tackle the difficulty of\nstoring massive GPU topology information, LiteGD adopts a computation-aware\ndesign that leverages a lightweight Transformer network trained on sampled\ndata. Our customized design for network structure ensures both transferability\nand scalability. LiteGD also employs a bidirectional tree search approach to\nfind the optimal GPU dispatching in the data generated in the previous step,\nwhich can identify near-optimal solutions while reducing search overhead. We\nimplement and evaluate LiteGD in both real and simulated GPU clusters with\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous interconnects, respectively. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LiteGD consistently achieves high GPU bandwidth efficacy\n(approximately 90\\%) across various cluster configurations and 80\\% in\nreal-world H100 cluster, significantly outperforming conventional default and\ninterconnect topology-aware dispatching methods, particularly in large-scale\nheterogeneous environments.", "comment": "12 pages, 19 figures,7 tables", "cate": "cs.DC", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15595v1"}

However, their large size often leads to noticeable\nlatency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting\nin suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs\nare deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with\nlimited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily\ndominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence,\nwhich is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses\non a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose\nPredictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even\neliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen\ngenerates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the\nsystem to begin TTS processing with minimal delay.

Our approach dynamically\nadapts the sub-network, avoiding premature decisions about a fixed sub-network\nstructure.

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

This paper demonstrates\nthat QO and BRE can be achieved using certain non-uniform meshes that violate\nthe conditions above on $h$ and involve coarser meshes away from trapping and\nin the perfectly matched layer (PML). The main theorem details how varying the\nmeshwidth in one region affects errors both in that region and elsewhere. One\nnotable consequence is that, for any scattering problem (trapping or\nnontrapping), in the PML one only needs $hk$ to be sufficiently small; i.e.\nthere is no pollution in the PML.\n  The motivating idea for the analysis is that the Helmholtz data-to-solution\nmap behaves differently depending on the locations of both the measurement and\ndata, in particular, on the properties of billiards trajectories (i.e. rays)\nthrough these sets. Because of this, it is natural that the approximation\nrequirements for finite-element spaces in a subset should depend on the\nproperties of billiard rays through that set.

Geometrically, these\nchannels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of\ncritical points.

To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the\nfirst dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level,\ntemporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich\nannotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver\nan interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization,\ntemporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach\nfundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box\ndecision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process. We demonstrate\nthat a general-purpose backbone, fine-tuned on our compact dataset and enhanced\nwith chain-of-thought distillation, achieves strong generalization across a\nvariety of generators and generation modes.

A hierarchical feature fusion mechanism\nemploys Hadamard products to explicitly model multilinear interactions, while\nstacked multilayer perceptron layers nonlinearly refine these representations\nto capture complex spatiotemporal couplings. Extensive evaluations on six urban\ntraffic datasets demonstrate NCPF's superiority over six state-of-the-art\nbaselines. By unifying CP decomposition's interpretable factor analysis with\nneural network's nonlinear expressive power, NCPF provides a principled yet\nflexible approaches for high-dimensional traffic data imputation, offering\ncritical support for next-generation transportation digital twins and adaptive\ntraffic control systems.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15079v1"}

Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition.

While $\\mu$P showed impressive results\nin practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations\nwhen applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\\mu$P is the fact\nthat input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking\nthe width to infinity.

In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model.

This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally\nefficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ndatasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We\ndeveloped a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and\npreprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model\ngeneralization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset\nof 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based\nconvolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary\nattention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)\nblocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To\naccelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum\nbatch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,\ntraining the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome\nKaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset\nyielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union\n(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and\nunderscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical\ndeployment.", "comment": "16 pages, 5 figures", "cate": "eess.IV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15562v1"}

In\nthe text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11\ninformation-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding\ntechniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's\nLLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four\nbenchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.\nThis improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream\nperformance.

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics\nframework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid\nrepresentation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion\ninformation while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of\nobjects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual\nrendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of\ndeformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase\nthe utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling\ngoal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

Although state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in\n3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited\nability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce\nrealistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we\nintroduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement\nlearning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.\nBuilt upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score\nfunction to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our\nNabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D\nreward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning\nbaselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,\nNabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting\nwithin a few finetuning steps.", "comment": "Technical Report (21 pages, 21 figures)", "cate": "cs.GR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15684v1"}
