ISAC designs\nfacilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving.\nSuch applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication\n(URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive\ntargets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability\nconstraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of\nURLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station\n(BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is\ndeployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest.

To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper\ncoding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and\nsensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for\nhandling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive\ninterference cancellation.

While\nprevious works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked\nto the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that\nthe graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we\nconsider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled\nby an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and\nonly the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split\nthe problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination\nstrategies.

To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution\nas well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning\nmethodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and\nonflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network\n(ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights\nof this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally\nexecuting transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this\napproach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i)\ndomain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target\ndomain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task\nadaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the\ninfluence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies\nvarying sampling sizes and architectures are provided.

In this work, we\nconsider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled\nby an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and\nonly the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split\nthe problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination\nstrategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm\nand, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph\nrecovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove\nthat its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with\nbounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective\npolynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph. Finally, we present experiments\non synthetic and real-world data that numerically validate our learning and\nvaccination algorithms.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15397v1"}

To address this gap, we propose physics-informed\npositional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical\ninformation into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping\nphysics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding\nmechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and\nsequential order of tokens within the embedding space.

Traditional methods typically treat\neach new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example,\nif a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must\nlearn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for\nprioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context\ninfluences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the\n$\\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove\nheat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety\npreference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn\ncontext-dependent representations $\\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing\nbetween preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data\nrequirements. Instead, we propose $\\textit{explicitly}$ modeling\ncontext-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature\nsaliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts.\nTo achieve this, we introduce $\\textit{calibrated features}$--representations\nthat capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized\npaired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient\nlearning.

A conventional approach to mitigate\nthis issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single\nlane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of\nmulti-deep storage systems.\n  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to\naddress the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous\nitem configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the\nobjective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's\ntopology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both\nitem attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep\nwarehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network\narchitecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer\nmodel. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into\nembeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these\nembeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong\ngeneralization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage\nsystems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including\ncomparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nneural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in\noptimizing retrieval tardiness.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14787v1"}

Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe\nconsequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We\naddress this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1.\nWe address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a\nfine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an\nexpressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can\nrun in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found\nthis voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods\nof expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a\nrobot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices\nin various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy\nand high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate\nand makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an\nEnglish TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known\nlinguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used\na data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use\nduration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax\n(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly\ninfluences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for\nMatcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels\nunchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and\nencouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these\nchallenging tense/lax minimal pairs.", "comment": "PhD Thesis Simon Fraser University https://summit.sfu.ca/item/39353\n  Read the Room: Adapting a Robot's Voice to Ambient and Social Contexts IROS\n  23 Mmm whatcha say?

This task requires\nMLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding\nnot only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual\nelements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex\ntask often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose\n{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.\nFirst, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To\naccomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of\nstructured instructions: description and difference. The description\ninstruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the\ndifference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference\nchart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual\nfeatures into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent\ncode translation process. Second, we decompose the overall chart generation\npipeline into two stages: initial code generation and iterative refinement,\nenabling progressive enhancement of the final output.

These interfaces are usually not\nshared alongside the results of the studies, which limits their reusability and\nthe reproducibility of experiments. In response, we design and implement\nWebXAII, a web-based platform that can embody full experimental protocols,\nmeaning that it can present all aspects of the experiment to human participants\nand record their responses. The experimental protocols are translated into a\ncomposite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of\nflexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so\nthat protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills. We\ndemonstrate that WebXAII can effectively embody relevant protocols, by\nreproducing the protocol of a state-of-the-art study of the literature.

Spence"], "summary": "The $h$-version of the finite-element method ($h$-FEM) applied to the\nhigh-frequency Helmholtz equation has been a classic topic in numerical\nanalysis since the 1990s. It is now rigorously understood that (using piecewise\npolynomials of degree $p$ on a mesh of a maximal width $h$) the conditions\n\"$(hk)^p \\rho$ sufficiently small\" and \"$(hk)^{2p} \\rho$ sufficiently small\"\nguarantee, respectively, $k$-uniform quasioptimality (QO) and bounded relative\nerror (BRE), where $\\rho$ is the norm of the solution operator with $\\rho\\sim\nk$ for non-trapping problems. Empirically, these conditions are observed to be\noptimal in the context of $h$-FEM with a uniform mesh. This paper demonstrates\nthat QO and BRE can be achieved using certain non-uniform meshes that violate\nthe conditions above on $h$ and involve coarser meshes away from trapping and\nin the perfectly matched layer (PML). The main theorem details how varying the\nmeshwidth in one region affects errors both in that region and elsewhere. One\nnotable consequence is that, for any scattering problem (trapping or\nnontrapping), in the PML one only needs $hk$ to be sufficiently small; i.e.\nthere is no pollution in the PML.\n  The motivating idea for the analysis is that the Helmholtz data-to-solution\nmap behaves differently depending on the locations of both the measurement and\ndata, in particular, on the properties of billiards trajectories (i.e. rays)\nthrough these sets. Because of this, it is natural that the approximation\nrequirements for finite-element spaces in a subset should depend on the\nproperties of billiard rays through that set. Inserting this behaviour into the\nlatest duality arguments for the FEM applied to the high-frequency Helmholtz\nequation allows us to retain detailed information about the influence of\n$\\textit{both}$ the mesh structure $\\textit{and}$ the behaviour of the true\nsolution on local errors in FEM.", "comment": null, "cate": "math.NA", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15630v1"}

To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF.

Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition.

While $\\mu$P showed impressive results\nin practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations\nwhen applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\\mu$P is the fact\nthat input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking\nthe width to infinity.

In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model.

This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally\nefficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ndatasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We\ndeveloped a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and\npreprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model\ngeneralization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset\nof 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based\nconvolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary\nattention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)\nblocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To\naccelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum\nbatch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,\ntraining the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome\nKaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset\nyielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union\n(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and\nunderscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical\ndeployment.", "comment": "16 pages, 5 figures", "cate": "eess.IV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15562v1"}

In\nthe text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11\ninformation-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding\ntechniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's\nLLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four\nbenchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response.\nThis improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream\nperformance.

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics\nframework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid\nrepresentation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion\ninformation while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of\nobjects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,\nwhile the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity\nand enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual\nrendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of\ndeformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse\nobjects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from\nsparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also\ngeneralizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,\nparticularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase\nthe utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling\ngoal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

Although state-of-the-art\ngenerative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in\n3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited\nability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce\nrealistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we\nintroduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement\nlearning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.\nBuilt upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score\nfunction to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our\nNabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D\nreward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning\nbaselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,\nNabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting\nwithin a few finetuning steps.", "comment": "Technical Report (21 pages, 21 figures)", "cate": "cs.GR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15684v1"}
