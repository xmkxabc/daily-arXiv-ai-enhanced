They have\nbeen generalised to include the modelling of composite systems that may contain\njunctions, i.e. lines along which three or more materials meet. Linear systems\nresulting upon discretisation of the PMCHWT are, because of their large\ndimension, typically solved by Krylov iterative methods. The number of\niterations required for this solution critically depends on the eigenvalue\ndistribution of the system matrix. For systems that do not contain junction\nlines, Calder\\'on preconditioning, which was first applied to the electric\nfield integral equation, has been generalised to the PMCHWT equation. When\njunctions are present, this approach cannot be applied. Alternative approaches,\nsuch as the global multi-trace method, conceptually remove the junction lines\nand as a result are amenable to Calder\\'on preconditioning. This approach\nentails a doubling of the degrees of freedom, and the solution that is produced\nonly approximately fulfils the continuity conditions at interfaces separating\ndomains. In this contribution, a single trace quasi-local PMCHWT equation is\nintroduced that requires a number of iterations for its solution that only\nslowly increases as the mesh size tends to zero. The method is constructed as a\ngeneralisation of the classic PMCHWT, and its discretisation is thoroughly\ndiscussed.

Even with\nthe added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.\nIn this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that\noutperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction\nphase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors\nexplicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision\nstrategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for\ntraditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.\nThrough extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art\nbenchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving\na threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,\nhighlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.GR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15821v1"}

UAV trajectory\noptimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time.\nIn this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry\ngas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path\nhaving minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical\nmodel is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the\nstate-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization\n(PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and\nbarnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the\nproposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient\nenvironment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex\nenvironment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms\nthe existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO\nalgorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8%\nreduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the\nHGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in\nsmart cities.", "comment": "12 pages, 9 figuers", "cate": "eess.SY", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15910v1"}

However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess\ndiverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding\nmodels rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive\nLearning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture\ndiverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by\nlearning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex\nstructures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic\ninformation effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic\ninformation, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating\nthem to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning\napproach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath\nembeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the\ndistance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance\nbetween those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the\nseparability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information.

These attacks pose significant threats to the\napplications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service\n(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can\nonly interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the\nattack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the\nbackdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden\ntrigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce\nBEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to\ndeactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed\nthe probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples\nsignificantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious\nprobe, while non-triggered samples have little effect.

These channels are often modeled as\ninsertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing\nmaximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we\npropose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design\nlow-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed\narchitecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN\nlog N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs\nrequire only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an\nexplicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)\nestimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS\nchannels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal\ndecoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower\ncomplexity than trellis-based decoders.

We propose a novel architecture for downlink RSMA,\nnamely Codeword-Segmentation RSMA (CS-RSMA). Different from conventional RSMA\nwhich splits users' messages into common and private parts before encoding,\nCS-RSMA encodes the users' messages directly, segments the codewords into\ncommon and private parts, and transmits the codeword segments using common and\nprivate streams. In addition to the principle of CS-RSMA, a novel performance\nanalysis framework is proposed. This framework utilizes a recent discovery in\nmismatched decoding under finite-alphabet input and interference, and can\nbetter capture the receiver's complexity limits. Precoder optimization under\nfinite alphabets and suboptimal decoders for conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA to\nmaximize the Sum-Rate (SR) and the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) is also addressed.\nThe numerical results reveal the theoretical performance of conventional RSMA\nand CS-RSMA.

RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system.

These\ninterdependencies are typically represented as mathematical expressions that\ndefine relations between process parameters, supporting tasks such as\ncalculation, validation, and simulation. To support cross-context application\nand knowledge reuse, such expressions are often defined in a generic form and\napplied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a\nconsistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data\nretrieval and interpretation. Consequently, dedicated mechanisms are required\nto address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring\nunit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the\ncompleteness of input data required for evaluating mathematical expressions.\nThis paper presents a set of verification mechanisms for a previously developed\nontology-based process model that integrates standardized process semantics,\ndata element definitions, and formal mathematical constructs.

However, the synthesized controller only\nensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single\ntrajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an\nentire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics\nmodel and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex\nfeasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring\nhigh dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to\nintegrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide\ndynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize\ncumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,\ncalled contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs\nto provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in\na fully automated setting.

At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal\nstate), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state)\nor state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition\nbetween states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over\ntime. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of\nprocesses. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden\nstate, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal\ndistribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search\nstrategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error\nprobability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d.\nobservations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a\nhidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly\nDetection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the\nprobing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive\nbelief updates over hidden states.

Beyond Equality of Opportunity", "authors": ["Youjin Kong"], "summary": "Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of\nresearch. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

Each component has been extensively studied, and in the backend\narchitecture, temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) have been widely adopted\nin state-of-the-art methods. Recently, dense skip connections have been\nintroduced in TCNs to mitigate the limited density of the receptive field,\nthereby improving the modeling of complex temporal representations. However,\ntheir performance remains constrained owing to potential information loss\nregarding the continuous nature of lip movements, caused by blind spots in the\nreceptive field. To address this limitation, we propose TD3Net, a temporal\ndensely connected multi-dilated convolutional network that combines dense skip\nconnections and multi-dilated temporal convolutions as the backend\narchitecture. TD3Net covers a wide and dense receptive field without blind\nspots by applying different dilation factors to skip-connected features.\nExperimental results on a word-level lipreading task using two large publicly\navailable datasets, Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) and LRW-1000, indicate that\nthe proposed method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art\nmethods.

This is particularly beneficial for high-order\ntensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the\norder. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis\nacross domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum\nphysics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is\nto optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as\ngradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and\ntensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly\nnonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing\nsignificant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.\n  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach\nto solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging\nthe canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained\nto be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient\ndescent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.\nUnder a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian\nregularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges\nto the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized.

These indiscriminate\ncalibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection\ndegrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive\ninformation. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these\nchallenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying\nsensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise\ninjection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in\nPSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the\nChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset. Moreover,\nit minimizes adverse effects on model performance, with less than 1\\% F1\nreduction compared to SOTA methods. Our extensive experiments, conducted across\ndiverse types of medical images, validate the generalization of the proposed\nframework.

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct.

This is especially\ncrucial in sensitive fields like healthcare, where protecting patient data is\nparamount. However, privacy leakage remains a critical challenge, as the\ncommunication of model updates can be exploited by potential adversaries.\nGradient inversion attacks (GIAs), for instance, allow adversaries to\napproximate the gradients used for training and reconstruct training images,\nthus stealing patient privacy. Existing defense mechanisms obscure gradients,\nyet lack a nuanced understanding of which gradients or types of image\ninformation are most vulnerable to such attacks. These indiscriminate\ncalibrated perturbations result in either excessive privacy protection\ndegrading model accuracy, or insufficient one failing to safeguard sensitive\ninformation. Therefore, we introduce a framework that addresses these\nchallenges by leveraging a shadow model with interpretability for identifying\nsensitive areas. This enables a more targeted and sample-specific noise\ninjection. Specially, our defensive strategy achieves discrepancies of 3.73 in\nPSNR and 0.2 in SSIM compared to the circumstance without defense on the\nChestXRay dataset, and 2.78 in PSNR and 0.166 in the EyePACS dataset.

To address these\nproblems, we propose a new paradigm of multi-model cooperative annotation and\ndesign a fully automatic annotation framework AutoAnnotator based on this.\nSpecifically, AutoAnnotator consists of two layers. The upper-level\nmeta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to\nselect SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify\ndifficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple\nSLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting.

To overcome this issue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived\nknowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing\nworks that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to\nISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected\nby ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting\nperformance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system\ntailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.\nFirst, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to\ntheir associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables\nefficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that\ndistributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a\nlightweight Flash Translation Layer. Third, REIS leverages an ANNS engine that\nuses the existing computational resources inside the storage system.

A\ntwo-stage analysis was conducted: first, a manual error analysis on a subsample\nidentified key phonological, lexical, and morphosyntactic errors behind ASR\nmisrecognitions; second, a case study focused on the systematic analysis of ASR\nrecognition of the regional pronouns ``yous'' and ``wor''.

To address this, we present\n$\\texttt{BLUR}$: a benchmark for LLM unlearning that provides more realistic\nscenarios of forget-retain overlap. $\\texttt{BLUR}$ significantly expands on\nexisting unlearning benchmarks by providing extended evaluation tasks, combined\nforget/retain queries, and relearning datasets of varying degrees of\ndifficulty. Despite the benign nature of the queries considered, we find that\nthe performance of existing methods drops significantly when evaluated on\n$\\texttt{BLUR}$, with simple approaches performing better on average than more\nrecent methods.

To address these issues, we propose to\nintegrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide\ndynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize\ncumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics.

However,\nquantifying epistemic uncertainty in such tasks is challenging due to the\npresence of aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from multiple valid answers.\nWhile bias can introduce noise into epistemic uncertainty estimation, it may\nalso reduce noise from aleatoric uncertainty. To investigate this trade-off, we\nconduct experiments on Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks and find that\nmitigating prompt-introduced bias improves uncertainty quantification in\nGPT-4o. Building on prior work showing that LLMs tend to copy input information\nwhen model confidence is low, we further analyze how these prompt biases affect\nmeasured epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty across varying bias-free\nconfidence levels with GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL. We find that all considered biases\ninduce greater changes in both uncertainties when bias-free model confidence is\nlower. Moreover, lower bias-free model confidence leads to greater\nunderestimation of epistemic uncertainty (i.e. overconfidence) due to bias,\nwhereas it has no significant effect on the direction of changes in aleatoric\nuncertainty estimation.

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling.

Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis\nacross domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum\nphysics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is\nto optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as\ngradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and\ntensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly\nnonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing\nsignificant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.\n  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach\nto solving various tensor decomposition problems.

This leads\nto unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded\nreasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1,\nan end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate\nwith constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a\ncompact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and\nreasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the\nenvironment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information.\nTo support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a\nsimple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn\nenvironments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task\nsequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA,\nopen-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves\nperformance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to\nQwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes\nbeyond the training horizon.

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess\ndiverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding\nmodels rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive\nLearning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture\ndiverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by\nlearning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex\nstructures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic\ninformation effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic\ninformation, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating\nthem to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning\napproach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath\nembeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the\ndistance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance\nbetween those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the\nseparability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that MHCL outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines in various graph machine learning tasks, effectively capturing the\ncomplex structures of heterogeneous graphs.", "comment": "14 pages, 9 figures", "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16754v1"}

Beyond Equality of Opportunity", "authors": ["Youjin Kong"], "summary": "Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of\nresearch. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

A promising approach towards this challenge is the design of\namortized samplers that borrow key ideas, such as probability path design, from\nstate-of-the-art generative diffusion models. However, all existing\ndiffusion-based samplers remain unable to draw samples from distributions at\nthe scale of even simple molecular systems. In this paper, we propose\nProgressive Inference-Time Annealing (PITA), a novel framework to learn\ndiffusion-based samplers that combines two complementary interpolation\ntechniques: I.) Annealing of the Boltzmann distribution and II.) Diffusion\nsmoothing. PITA trains a sequence of diffusion models from high to low\ntemperatures by sequentially training each model at progressively higher\ntemperatures, leveraging engineered easy access to samples of the\ntemperature-annealed target density. In the subsequent step, PITA enables\nsimulating the trained diffusion model to procure training samples at a lower\ntemperature for the next diffusion model through inference-time annealing using\na novel Feynman-Kac PDE combined with Sequential Monte Carlo. Empirically, PITA\nenables, for the first time, equilibrium sampling of N-body particle systems,\nAlanine Dipeptide, and tripeptides in Cartesian coordinates with dramatically\nlower energy function evaluations.

We propose a formal framework for evaluating whether\nan LLM exhibits a sufficiently robust world model, defined as producing\nconsistent outputs across semantically equivalent prompts while distinguishing\nbetween prompts that express different intents. We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording. We apply this framework to evaluate LLMs\nacross diverse domains. Our results show how larger models attribute a greater\nshare of output variability to changes in user purpose, indicating a more\nrobust world model. This improvement is not uniform, however: larger models do\nnot consistently outperform smaller ones across all domains, and their\nadvantage in robustness is often modest.

Many\nsuch time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments\nwith a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal\nstructure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for\nanalyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this\nsetting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have\nits own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,\nwhich may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery\napproaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity\nor Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified\nframework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with\nnon Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the\nnumber of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's\nDirected Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm\nthat maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood.

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models.

Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses.

This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive\nLearning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture\ndiverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by\nlearning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex\nstructures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic\ninformation effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic\ninformation, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating\nthem to obtain node representations.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality.

We present an\nalternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir\ncomputing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and\nmaps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly\nparallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in\nneural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,\nadaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our\nreservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination\nfidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error\nreductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets,\nrespectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit\ndataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model\nrequires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for\nfive-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance\nqubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum\nprocessors.", "comment": null, "cate": "quant-ph", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15771v1"}

The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs.

Notably, the\ndiagonalization approach of LNNs reduces computational complexity while\nretaining some interpretability, enabling real-time receding horizon control.\nThese findings highlight the advantages of LNNs in capturing the underlying\nstructure of system dynamics in quadrupeds, leading to improved performance and\nefficiency in locomotion planning and control. Additionally, our approach\nachieves a higher control frequency than previous LNN methods, demonstrating\nits potential for real-world deployment on quadrupeds.", "comment": "6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at Advances in Robotics (AIR) Conference\n  2025", "cate": "cs.RO", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16079v1"}

Many\nsuch time series exhibit multiple regimes, i.e., consecutive temporal segments\nwith a priori unknown boundaries, with each regime having its own causal\nstructure. Inferring causal dependencies and regime shifts is critical for\nanalyzing the underlying processes. However, causal structure learning in this\nsetting is challenging due to (1) non stationarity, i.e., each regime can have\nits own causal graph and mixing function, and (2) complex noise distributions,\nwhich may be non Gaussian or heteroscedastic. Existing causal discovery\napproaches cannot address these challenges, since generally assume stationarity\nor Gaussian noise with constant variance. Hence, we introduce FANTOM, a unified\nframework for causal discovery that handles non stationary processes along with\nnon Gaussian and heteroscedastic noises. FANTOM simultaneously infers the\nnumber of regimes and their corresponding indices and learns each regime's\nDirected Acyclic Graph. It uses a Bayesian Expectation Maximization algorithm\nthat maximizes the evidence lower bound of the data log likelihood.

We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained\ndescriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights,\ncontains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To\ndemonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides\ntimestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges\nspecializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding\nwindows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions,\ngenerating accurate timestamps for these events.

SyncMapV2 exhibits a minimal\ndrop in mIoU, only 0.01%, under digital corruption, compared to a 23.8% drop\nobserved in SOTA methods.This superior performance extends across various types\nof corruption: noise (7.3% vs. 37.7%), weather (7.5% vs. 33.8%), and blur (7.0%\nvs. 29.5%).

It is based on a learning paradigm that uses\nself-organizing dynamical equations combined with concepts from random\nnetworks. Moreover,unlike conventional methods that require re-initialization\nfor each new input, SyncMapV2 adapts online, mimicking the continuous\nadaptability of human vision.

We investigate an alternative class of methods,\nReinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on\nintrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we\nleverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy,\ntrajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows\nthese internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate\nvarious RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs\nat the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques\non these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even\nbelow the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little\nimprovement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of\nintrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze\nthis limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's\ntraining behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal\nfeedback signals into LLM training.
