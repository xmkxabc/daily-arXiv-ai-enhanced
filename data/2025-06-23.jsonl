They have\nbeen generalised to include the modelling of composite systems that may contain\njunctions, i.e. lines along which three or more materials meet. Linear systems\nresulting upon discretisation of the PMCHWT are, because of their large\ndimension, typically solved by Krylov iterative methods. The number of\niterations required for this solution critically depends on the eigenvalue\ndistribution of the system matrix. For systems that do not contain junction\nlines, Calder\\'on preconditioning, which was first applied to the electric\nfield integral equation, has been generalised to the PMCHWT equation. When\njunctions are present, this approach cannot be applied. Alternative approaches,\nsuch as the global multi-trace method, conceptually remove the junction lines\nand as a result are amenable to Calder\\'on preconditioning. This approach\nentails a doubling of the degrees of freedom, and the solution that is produced\nonly approximately fulfils the continuity conditions at interfaces separating\ndomains. In this contribution, a single trace quasi-local PMCHWT equation is\nintroduced that requires a number of iterations for its solution that only\nslowly increases as the mesh size tends to zero. The method is constructed as a\ngeneralisation of the classic PMCHWT, and its discretisation is thoroughly\ndiscussed.

Even with\nthe added cost, the resulting reconstruction quality often remains suboptimal.\nIn this paper, we present VEIGAR, a computationally efficient framework that\noutperforms existing methods without relying on an initial reconstruction\nphase. VEIGAR leverages a lightweight foundation model to reliably align priors\nexplicitly in the pixel space. In addition, we introduce a novel supervision\nstrategy based on scale-invariant depth loss, which removes the need for\ntraditional scale-and-shift operations in monocular depth regularization.\nThrough extensive experimentation, VEIGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art\nbenchmark in reconstruction quality and cross-view consistency, while achieving\na threefold reduction in training time compared to the fastest existing method,\nhighlighting its superior balance of efficiency and effectiveness.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.GR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15821v1"}

UAV trajectory\noptimization deals with finding the shortest path in the minimal possible time.\nIn this paper, a cluster optimization scheme (COS) is proposed using the Henry\ngas optimization (HGO) metaheuristic algorithm to identify the shortest path\nhaving minimal transportation cost and algorithm complexity. The mathematical\nmodel is designed for COS using the HGO algorithm and compared with the\nstate-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization\n(PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and\nbarnacles mating optimizer (BMO). In order to prove the robustness of the\nproposed model, four different scenarios are evaluated that includes ambient\nenvironment, constrict environment, tangled environment, and complex\nenvironment. In all the aforementioned scenarios, the HGO algorithm outperforms\nthe existing algorithms. Particularly, in the ambient environment, the HGO\nalgorithm achieves a 39.3% reduction in transportation cost and a 16.8%\nreduction in computational time as compared to the PSO algorithm. Hence, the\nHGO algorithm can be used for autonomous trajectory optimization of UAVs in\nsmart cities.", "comment": "12 pages, 9 figuers", "cate": "eess.SY", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15910v1"}

However, although heterogeneous graphs inherently possess\ndiverse power-law structures, most hyperbolic heterogeneous graph embedding\nmodels rely on a single hyperbolic space. This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive\nLearning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture\ndiverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by\nlearning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex\nstructures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic\ninformation effectively. Since metapath embeddings represent distinct semantic\ninformation, preserving their discriminability is important when aggregating\nthem to obtain node representations. Therefore, we use a contrastive learning\napproach to optimize MHCL and improve the discriminability of metapath\nembeddings. In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the\ndistance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance\nbetween those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the\nseparability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL.

These attacks pose significant threats to the\napplications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service\n(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can\nonly interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the\nattack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the\nbackdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden\ntrigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce\nBEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to\ndeactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed\nthe probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples\nsignificantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious\nprobe, while non-triggered samples have little effect.

Different from conventional RSMA\nwhich splits users' messages into common and private parts before encoding,\nCS-RSMA encodes the users' messages directly, segments the codewords into\ncommon and private parts, and transmits the codeword segments using common and\nprivate streams. In addition to the principle of CS-RSMA, a novel performance\nanalysis framework is proposed. This framework utilizes a recent discovery in\nmismatched decoding under finite-alphabet input and interference, and can\nbetter capture the receiver's complexity limits. Precoder optimization under\nfinite alphabets and suboptimal decoders for conventional RSMA and CS-RSMA to\nmaximize the Sum-Rate (SR) and the Max-Min Fairness (MMF) is also addressed.\nThe numerical results reveal the theoretical performance of conventional RSMA\nand CS-RSMA. We observe that CS-RSMA leads to better performance than\nconventional RSMA in SR, and similar performance in MMF. Furthermore, a\nphysical-layer implementation of CS-RSMA is proposed and evaluated through\nlink-level simulations.

To overcome this issue,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the static training-derived\nknowledge of LLMs with an external knowledge repository. RAG consists of three\nstages: indexing, retrieval, and generation. The retrieval stage of RAG becomes\na significant bottleneck in inference pipelines. In this stage, a user query is\nmapped to an embedding vector and an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS)\nalgorithm searches for similar vectors in the database to identify relevant\nitems. Due to the large database sizes, ANNS incurs significant data movement\noverheads between the host and the storage system. To alleviate these\noverheads, prior works propose In-Storage Processing (ISP) techniques that\naccelerate ANNS by performing computations inside storage. However, existing\nworks that leverage ISP for ANNS (i) employ algorithms that are not tailored to\nISP systems, (ii) do not accelerate data retrieval operations for data selected\nby ANNS, and (iii) introduce significant hardware modifications, limiting\nperformance and hindering their adoption. We propose REIS, the first ISP system\ntailored for RAG that addresses these limitations with three key mechanisms.\nFirst, REIS employs a database layout that links database embedding vectors to\ntheir associated documents, enabling efficient retrieval. Second, it enables\nefficient ANNS by introducing an ISP-tailored data placement technique that\ndistributes embeddings across the planes of the storage system and employs a\nlightweight Flash Translation Layer.

However, the synthesized controller only\nensures that all the trajectories of the system converge to one single\ntrajectory and, as such, does not impose any notion of optimality across an\nentire trajectory. Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics\nmodel and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex\nfeasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring\nhigh dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to\nintegrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide\ndynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize\ncumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,\ncalled contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs\nto provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in\na fully automated setting. Given a pre-trained dynamics model, CAC\nsimultaneously learns a contraction metric generator (CMG) -- which generates a\ncontraction metric -- and uses an actor-critic algorithm to learn an optimal\ntracking policy guided by that metric.

However, producing outputs that are\nconsistently honest and helpful remains an open challenge. To overcome this\nchallenge, this paper tackles the problem through two complementary directions.\nIt conducts a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of ten widely used large\nlanguage models, including both proprietary and open-weight models from OpenAI,\nMeta, and Google. In parallel, it proposes a novel prompting strategy,\nself-critique-guided curiosity refinement prompting. The key idea behind this\nstrategy is enabling models to self-critique and refine their responses without\nadditional training. The proposed method extends the curiosity-driven prompting\nstrategy by incorporating two lightweight in-context steps including\nself-critique step and refinement step.\n  The experiment results on the HONESET dataset evaluated using the framework\n$\\mathrm{H}^2$ (honesty and helpfulness), which was executed with GPT-4o as a\njudge of honesty and helpfulness, show consistent improvements across all\nmodels. The approach reduces the number of poor-quality responses, increases\nhigh-quality responses, and achieves relative gains in $\\mathrm{H}^2$ scores\nranging from 1.4% to 4.3% compared to curiosity-driven prompting across\nevaluated models.

At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal\nstate), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state)\nor state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition\nbetween states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over\ntime. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of\nprocesses. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden\nstate, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal\ndistribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search\nstrategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error\nprobability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d.\nobservations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a\nhidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly\nDetection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the\nprobing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive\nbelief updates over hidden states.

Beyond Equality of Opportunity", "authors": ["Youjin Kong"], "summary": "Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of\nresearch. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

This is the basis for\none of the most important abstractions in computer science, allowing hardware\ndesigners to develop highly-optimized processors that are functionally\n\"equivalent\" to an ideal processor that executes instructions atomically. This\nspecification is almost always informal, e.g., commercial microprocessors\ngenerally do not come with conformance specifications. In this paper, we\nadvocate for the use of formal specifications, using the theory of refinement.\nWe introduce notions of correctness that can be used to deal with transient\nexecution attacks, including Meltdown and Spectre. Such attacks have shown that\nubiquitous microprocessor optimizations, appearing in numerous processors for\ndecades, are inherently buggy. Unlike alternative approaches that use\nnon-interference properties, our notion of correctness is global, meaning it is\nsingle specification that: formalizes conformance, includes functional\ncorrectness and is parameterized by an microarchitecture. We introduce action\nskipping refinement, a new type of refinement and we describe how our notions\nof refinement can be decomposed into properties that are more amenable to\nautomated verification using the the concept of shared-resource commitment\nrefinement maps.

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method\nthat introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching\nteacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from\nsemantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded\nrepresentations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a\nfrozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet\ndata-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are\nmore semantically aligned with language models.

Wakin", "Zhihui Zhu"], "summary": "Tensor decompositions, which represent an $N$-order tensor using\napproximately $N$ factors of much smaller dimensions, can significantly reduce\nthe number of parameters. This is particularly beneficial for high-order\ntensors, as the number of entries in a tensor grows exponentially with the\norder. Consequently, they are widely used in signal recovery and data analysis\nacross domains such as signal processing, machine learning, and quantum\nphysics. A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is\nto optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as\ngradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and\ntensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly\nnonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing\nsignificant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.\n  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach\nto solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging\nthe canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained\nto be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient\ndescent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.\nUnder a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian\nregularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges\nto the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized. Notably,\nboth the initialization requirement and the convergence rate scale polynomially\nrather than exponentially with $N$, improving upon existing results for Tucker\nand tensor-train format tensors.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16032v1"}

Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where\nprofit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore,\nwhen the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly\ncollude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same\nmechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where\nmutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both\nprisoners in one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game,\na class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much\nattention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are\nautocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players. There were\nmany attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend\nthem so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show\nthat zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly\ngame. Especially, we prove that an averagely unbeatable zero-determinant\nstrategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the\nopponents. Second, we numerically show that the averagely unbeatable\nzero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used\nagainst an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when\nit is used against two adaptively learning players.

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation.

MTL typically accomplishes this goal by\nlearning a shared representation that captures common structure among the tasks\nby embedding data from all tasks into a common feature space. Despite being\ndesigned to be the smallest unit of shared information necessary to effectively\nlearn patterns across multiple tasks, these shared representations can\ninadvertently leak sensitive information about the particular tasks they were\ntrained on.\n  In this work, we investigate what information is revealed by the shared\nrepresentations through the lens of inference attacks. Towards this, we propose\na novel, black-box task-inference threat model where the adversary, given the\nembedding vectors produced by querying the shared representation on samples\nfrom a particular task, aims to determine whether that task was present when\ntraining the shared representation. We develop efficient, purely black-box\nattacks on machine learning models that exploit the dependencies between\nembeddings from the same task without requiring shadow models or labeled\nreference data. We evaluate our attacks across vision and language domains for\nmultiple use cases of MTL and demonstrate that even with access only to fresh\ntask samples rather than training data, a black-box adversary can successfully\ninfer a task's inclusion in training.

Extracting and\nmodeling degradation patterns for super-resolution reconstruction using only\nreal-world low-resolution (LR) images remains a challenging task. When\nsynthesizing datasets to simulate real-world degradation, relying solely on\ndegradation extraction methods fails to capture both blur and diverse noise\ncharacteristics across varying LR distributions, as well as more implicit\ndegradations such as color gamut shifts. Conversely, domain translation alone\ncannot accurately approximate real-world blur characteristics due to the\nsignificant degradation domain gap between synthetic and real data. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel TripleGAN framework comprising two\nstrategically designed components: The FirstGAN primarily focuses on narrowing\nthe domain gap in blur characteristics, while the SecondGAN performs\ndomain-specific translation to approximate target-domain blur properties and\nlearn additional degradation patterns.

We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation.

In this paper, we introduce a\ncomputational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,\nsuch as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,\nwe create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations\nfrom 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable\ninsights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We\nfurther develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong\nperformance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of\nscience from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors\naffect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a\npredictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement\nwith science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption\nis the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal\ninfluence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully\ndesigned natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public\nperception of scientific information has direct connections with the final\nengagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive\nsignificantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different\nscientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.\nOverall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception\nmodeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public\ninterest and engagement with scientific content.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CL", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16622v1"}

Furthermore, constructing CCMs requires a known dynamics\nmodel and non-trivial effort in solving an infinite-dimensional convex\nfeasibility problem, which limits its scalability to complex systems featuring\nhigh dimensionality with uncertainty. To address these issues, we propose to\nintegrate CCMs into reinforcement learning (RL), where CCMs provide\ndynamics-informed feedback for learning control policies that minimize\ncumulative tracking error under unknown dynamics. We show that our algorithm,\ncalled contraction actor-critic (CAC), formally enhances the capability of CCMs\nto provide a set of contracting policies with the long-term optimality of RL in\na fully automated setting.

To reduce the cost of\nindex retrieval, existing methods often treat each decoding step as an\nindependent process, failing to exploit the temporal correlations embedded in\nhistorical decoding information. To this end, we propose LFPS(Learn From the\nPast for Sparse Indexing), an acceleration method that dynamically constructs\nsparse indexing candidates based on historical attention patterns.

While\nrecent AI models have shown promise in detecting such patterns from patient\nfacial videos, their reliance on real patient data raises significant ethical\nand privacy challenges -- especially when training robust and generalizable\nmodels across institutions. To address these concerns, we propose SafeTriage, a\nnovel method designed to de-identify patient facial videos while preserving\nessential motion cues crucial for stroke diagnosis. SafeTriage leverages a\npretrained video motion transfer (VMT) model to map the motion characteristics\nof real patient faces onto synthetic identities. This approach retains\ndiagnostically relevant facial dynamics without revealing the patients'\nidentities. To mitigate the distribution shift between normal population\npre-training videos and patient population test videos, we introduce a\nconditional generative model for visual prompt tuning, which adapts the input\nspace of the VMT model to ensure accurate motion transfer without needing to\nfine-tune the VMT model backbone. Comprehensive evaluation, including\nquantitative metrics and clinical expert assessments, demonstrates that\nSafeTriage-produced synthetic videos effectively preserve stroke-relevant\nfacial patterns, enabling reliable AI-based triage.

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment.

Current methods either disrupt the model's\ninherent structure or introduce severe long-context computational burden,\nseverely limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink\nmultimodal integration and present LaVi, a novel LVLM that enables seamless and\nefficient vision-language fusion through internal feature modulation within the\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Unlike dominant LVLMs that rely on visual token\nconcatenation, LaVi bypasses long-context expansion by introducing a\nlightweight and adaptive transformation, which incorporates visual context by\ninjecting token-wise vision-conditioned deltas into the affine parameters of\nlayer normalization. This mechanism directly modulates linguistic hidden states\nbased on visual input, ensuring precise vision-language alignment while\npreserving the LLM's linguistic priors and drastically reducing computational\ncosts. Extensive evaluations across 15 image and video benchmarks demonstrate\nthat LaVi not only achieves state-of-the-art multimodal performance but also\ndramatically enhances efficiency. Compared to LLaVA-OV-7B, LaVi reduces FLOPs\nby 94.0%, improves inference speed by 3.1 times, and cuts memory usage in half\n- establishing LaVi as a scalable and practical solution for real-time\nmultimodal reasoning.

A computationally and memory-efficient approach to these problems is\nto optimize directly over the factors using local search algorithms such as\ngradient descent, a strategy known as the factorization approach in matrix and\ntensor optimization. However, the resulting optimization problems are highly\nnonconvex due to the multiplicative interactions between factors, posing\nsignificant challenges for convergence analysis and recovery guarantees.\n  In this paper, we present a unified framework for the factorization approach\nto solving various tensor decomposition problems. Specifically, by leveraging\nthe canonical form of tensor decompositions--where most factors are constrained\nto be orthonormal to mitigate scaling ambiguity--we apply Riemannian gradient\ndescent (RGD) to optimize these orthonormal factors on the Stiefel manifold.\nUnder a mild condition on the loss function, we establish a Riemannian\nregularity condition for the factorized objective and prove that RGD converges\nto the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate when properly initialized.

These attacks pose significant threats to the\napplications of LLMs in the real-world Large Language Model as a Service\n(LLMaaS) setting, where the deployed model is a fully black-box system that can\nonly interact through text. Furthermore, the sample-dependent nature of the\nattack target exacerbates the threat. Instead of outputting a fixed label, the\nbackdoored LLM follows the semantics of any malicious command with the hidden\ntrigger, significantly expanding the target space. In this paper, we introduce\nBEAT, a black-box defense that detects triggered samples during inference to\ndeactivate the backdoor. It is motivated by an intriguing observation (dubbed\nthe probe concatenate effect), where concatenated triggered samples\nsignificantly reduce the refusal rate of the backdoored LLM towards a malicious\nprobe, while non-triggered samples have little effect. Specifically, BEAT\nidentifies whether an input is triggered by measuring the degree of distortion\nin the output distribution of the probe before and after concatenation with the\ninput.

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks.

In\nresponse, we propose FlowRAM, a novel framework that leverages generative\nmodels to achieve region-aware perception, enabling efficient multimodal\ninformation processing. Specifically, we devise a Dynamic Radius Schedule,\nwhich allows adaptive perception, facilitating transitions from global scene\ncomprehension to fine-grained geometric details. Furthermore, we integrate\nstate space models to integrate multimodal information, while preserving linear\ncomputational complexity. In addition, we employ conditional flow matching to\nlearn action poses by regressing deterministic vector fields, simplifying the\nlearning process while maintaining performance. We verify the effectiveness of\nthe FlowRAM in the RLBench, an established manipulation benchmark, and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrate that FlowRAM achieves a\nremarkable improvement, particularly in high-precision tasks, where it\noutperforms previous methods by 12.0% in average success rate.

Beyond Equality of Opportunity", "authors": ["Youjin Kong"], "summary": "Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of\nresearch. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also\noutlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML\npipeline.", "comment": "Accepted for presentation at ACM FAccT 2025; under final review\n  (minor revision) at an ACM journal", "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16782v1"}

Traditional centralized learning\napproaches to detect fitness activities struggle with privacy concerns,\nregulatory constraints, and communication inefficiencies.

In this paper, we introduce a\ncomputational framework that models public perception across twelve dimensions,\nsuch as newsworthiness, importance, and surprisingness. Using this framework,\nwe create a large-scale science news perception dataset with 10,489 annotations\nfrom 2,101 participants from diverse US and UK populations, providing valuable\ninsights into public responses to scientific information across domains. We\nfurther develop NLP models that predict public perception scores with a strong\nperformance. Leveraging the dataset and model, we examine public perception of\nscience from two perspectives: (1) Perception as an outcome: What factors\naffect the public perception of scientific information? (2) Perception as a\npredictor: Can we use the estimated perceptions to predict public engagement\nwith science? We find that individuals' frequency of science news consumption\nis the driver of perception, whereas demographic factors exert minimal\ninfluence. More importantly, through a large-scale analysis and carefully\ndesigned natural experiment on Reddit, we demonstrate that the estimated public\nperception of scientific information has direct connections with the final\nengagement pattern. Posts with more positive perception scores receive\nsignificantly more comments and upvotes, which is consistent across different\nscientific information and for the same science, but are framed differently.\nOverall, this research underscores the importance of nuanced perception\nmodeling in science communication, offering new pathways to predict public\ninterest and engagement with scientific content.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CL", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16622v1"}

Recent speech tokenization approaches aim\nto isolate semantic information from low-level acoustics to better align with\nlanguage models. In particular, previous methods use SSL teachers such as\nHuBERT to extract semantic representations, which are then distilled into a\nsemantic quantizer to suppress acoustic redundancy as well as capture\ncontent-related latent structures. However, they still produce speech token\nsequences significantly longer than their textual counterparts, creating\nchallenges for efficient speech-language modeling. Reducing the frame rate is a\nnatural solution, but standard techniques, such as rigid average pooling across\nframes, can distort or dilute the semantic structure required for effective LM\nalignment. To address this, we propose LM-SPT, a speech tokenization method\nthat introduces a novel semantic distillation. Instead of directly matching\nteacher and student features via pooling, we reconstruct speech solely from\nsemantic tokens and minimize the discrepancy between the encoded\nrepresentations of the original and reconstructed waveforms, obtained from a\nfrozen automatic speech recognition (ASR) encoder. This indirect yet\ndata-driven supervision enables the tokenizer to learn discrete units that are\nmore semantically aligned with language models.

Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses.

This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Metapath-based Hyperbolic Contrastive\nLearning framework (MHCL), which uses multiple hyperbolic spaces to capture\ndiverse complex structures within heterogeneous graphs. Specifically, by\nlearning each hyperbolic space to describe the distribution of complex\nstructures corresponding to each metapath, it is possible to capture semantic\ninformation effectively.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality.

The Koopman operator acts on a function\nspace and is most commonly studied on the space of square-integrable functions.\nHowever, defining it on a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)\noffers numerous practical advantages, including pointwise predictions with\nerror bounds, improved spectral properties that facilitate computations, and\nmore efficient algorithms, particularly in high dimensions. We introduce the\nfirst general, provably convergent, data-driven algorithms for computing\nspectral properties of Koopman and Perron--Frobenius operators on RKHSs. These\nmethods efficiently compute spectra and pseudospectra with error control and\nspectral measures while exploiting the RKHS structure to avoid the large-data\nlimits required in the $L^2$ settings. The function space is determined by a\nuser-specified kernel, eliminating the need for quadrature-based sampling as in\n$L^2$ and enabling greater flexibility with finite, externally provided\ndatasets. Using the Solvability Complexity Index hierarchy, we construct\nadversarial dynamical systems for these problems to show that no algorithm can\nsucceed in fewer limits, thereby proving the optimality of our algorithms.\nNotably, this impossibility extends to randomized algorithms and datasets. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on challenging,\nhigh-dimensional datasets arising from real-world measurements and\nhigh-fidelity numerical simulations, including turbulent channel flow,\nmolecular dynamics of a binding protein, Antarctic sea ice concentration, and\nNorthern Hemisphere sea surface height.

Employing this approach enables\nsimultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while\nproviding a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is\nused to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto\n(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding\nto enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and\nfinite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nparticularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution\nis non-uniform.

Early experimental proposals, such as the\nrestarting and rewinding protocols, relied on repeating previous steps of the\nquantum map to avoid backaction. However, this approach compromises real-time\nprocessing and increases computational overhead. Recent developments have\nintroduced alternative protocols that address these limitations. These include\nonline, mid-circuit measurement, and feedback techniques, which enable\nreal-time computation while preserving the input history. Among these, the\nfeedback protocol stands out for its ability to process temporal information\nwith comparatively fewer components. Despite this potential advantage, the\ntheoretical foundations of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing remain\nunderdeveloped, particularly with regard to the universality and the\napproximation capabilities of this approach. This paper addresses this issue by\npresenting a recurrent quantum neural network architecture that extends a class\nof existing feedforward models to a dynamic, feedback-driven reservoir setting.\nWe provide theoretical guarantees for variational recurrent quantum neural\nnetworks, including approximation bounds and universality results.

We introduce a new evaluation\napproach to measure this that decomposes model response variability into three\ncomponents: variability due to user purpose, user articulation, and model\ninstability. An LLM with a strong world model should attribute most of the\nvariability in its responses to changes in foundational purpose rather than\nsuperficial changes in articulation. This approach allows us to quantify how\nmuch of a model's behavior is semantically grounded rather than driven by model\ninstability or alternative wording.

We present latent diffusion for full\nprotein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom\nprotein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from\nmolecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural\nnetwork (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein\nconformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind,\nsequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent\nrepresentations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by\ndihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates.

These channels are often modeled as\ninsertion-deletion-substitution (IDS) channels, for which designing\nmaximum-likelihood decoders is computationally expensive. In this work, we\npropose a data-driven approach based on neural polar decoders (NPDs) to design\nlow-complexity decoders for channels with synchronization errors. The proposed\narchitecture enables decoding over IDS channels with reduced complexity $O(AN\nlog N )$, where $A$ is a tunable parameter independent of the channel. NPDs\nrequire only sample access to the channel and can be trained without an\nexplicit channel model. Additionally, NPDs provide mutual information (MI)\nestimates that can be used to optimize input distributions and code design. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NPDs on both synthetic deletion and IDS\nchannels. For deletion channels, we show that NPDs achieve near-optimal\ndecoding performance and accurate MI estimation, with significantly lower\ncomplexity than trellis-based decoders. We also provide numerical estimates of\nthe channel capacity for the deletion channel. We extend our evaluation to\nrealistic DNA storage settings, including channels with multiple noisy reads\nand real-world Nanopore sequencing data.
