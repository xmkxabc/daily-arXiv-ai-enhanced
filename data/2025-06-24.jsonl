Blockchains are distributed\nsystems that order and timestamp records of a given network of users, in a\npublic, cryptographically secure, and consensual way. The records, which may in\nkind be events, transaction orders, sets of rules for structured transactions\netc. are placed within well-defined datastructures called blocks, and they are\nlinked to each other by the virtue of cryptographic pointers, in a total\nordering which represents their temporal relations of succession. The ability\nto operate on the blockchain, and/or to contribute a record to the content of a\nblock are shared resources of the blockchain systems. In commercial networks,\nthese resources are exchanged in return for fiat money, and consequently,\nfairness is not a relevant problem in terms of computer engineering. In\nnon-commercial networks, however, monetary solutions are not available, by\ndefinition. The present non-commercial blockchain networks employ trivial\ndistribution mechanisms called faucets, which offer fixed amounts of free\ntokens (called cryptocurrencies) specific to the given network. This mechanism,\nalthough simple and efficient, is prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks and\ncannot address the fairness problem. In the present dissertation, the faucet\nmechanism is adapted for fair distribution, in line with Max-min Fairness\nscheme. In total, we contributed 6 distinct Max-min Fair algorithms as\nefficient blockchain faucets.

In the\nsecond stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters\nunder noiseless conditions.

We first propose a general framework that\nmodifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and\ntheir structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct\nextensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative\nopen-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt\ntemplates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical\nmetrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings\nsuggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in\nperformance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce\ninconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models.

The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks.

While\nspecialized network infrastructure (e.g., time-sensitive networking (TSN)\nswitches) provides deterministic data transport across the network, achieving\nstrict end-to-end timing guarantees requires equally capable end devices to\nsupport deterministic traffic. These end devices, however, often employ\ngeneral-purpose computing platforms like standard PCs, which lack native\nsupport for deterministic traffic and suffer from unpredictable delays\nintroduced by their software stack and system architecture. Although\nspecialized NICs with hardware scheduling offload can mitigate this problem,\nthe limited compatibility hinders their widespread adoption, particularly for\ncost-sensitive applications or in legacy devices.\n  To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel software-based driver model,\nnamely KeepON, to enable the support of deterministic packet transmissions on\nend devices equipped with standard NICs. The key idea of KeepON is to have the\nNIC keep on transmitting fixed-size data chunks as placeholders, thereby\nmaintaining a predictable temporal transmission pattern.

The irreversible nature of this preprocessing step can\ndiscard valuable object-related information, particularly impairing the ability\nto resolve weak or closely spaced objects. The track-before-detect (TBD)\nparadigm offers an alternative by operating directly on sensor data.

These assumptions\ncan lead to suboptimal performance and limit the applicability of the resulting\nTBD methods in realistic scenarios.\n  This paper introduces coherent TBD based on a comprehensive signal model for\nsensor data.

Traditional\nnormalizing flow methods require reversible architectures, which can limit\ntheir expressiveness and efficiency. Although diffusion models offer greater\nflexibility, they often suffer from high computational costs during inference.\nTo combine the strengths of both approaches, we introduce a two-stage method.\nFirst, we construct a training-free conditional diffusion model by analytically\nderiving an exact score function under a Gaussian mixture prior formed from\nsamples of the underlying joint distribution. This exact conditional score\nmodel allows us to efficiently generate noise-labeled data, consisting of\ninitial diffusion Gaussian noise and posterior samples conditioned on various\nobservation values, by solving a reverse-time ordinary differential equation.\nSecond, we use this noise-labeled data to train a feedforward neural network\nthat maps noise and observations directly to posterior samples, eliminating the\nneed for reversibility or iterative sampling at inference time. The resulting\nmodel provides fast, accurate, and scalable conditional sampling for\nhigh-dimensional and multi-modal posterior distributions, making it well-suited\nfor uncertainty quantification tasks, e.g., parameter estimation of complex\nphysical systems.

A simple yet\neffective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing).\nUnfortunately, existing fuzzing techniques have not comprehensively considered\nmultiple types of feedback. Additionally, they analyze feedback in a\ncoarse-grained manner, such as mutating the test cases only according to\nwhether the coverage increases. Recently, researchers introduced Large Language\nModels (LLMs) into fuzzing.

We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf.", "comment": "12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables", "cate": "cs.CL", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17367v1"}

However, prior work has focused on\nsolely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image\nportions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium\nto communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that\nleverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.\nImage Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their\nbias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias\nscore of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting\nbiased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three\nsteps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and\nthe image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by\ncomparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is\npromising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many\npotential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective\ntraining.

Traditional\nnumerical methods are often limited by high computational costs and low\nefficiency, while deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative.\nHowever, these data-driven methods still face challenges, such as limited\nphysical interpretability and difficulty in adapting to diverse structural\nconfigurations.

Blockchains are distributed\nsystems that order and timestamp records of a given network of users, in a\npublic, cryptographically secure, and consensual way. The records, which may in\nkind be events, transaction orders, sets of rules for structured transactions\netc. are placed within well-defined datastructures called blocks, and they are\nlinked to each other by the virtue of cryptographic pointers, in a total\nordering which represents their temporal relations of succession. The ability\nto operate on the blockchain, and/or to contribute a record to the content of a\nblock are shared resources of the blockchain systems. In commercial networks,\nthese resources are exchanged in return for fiat money, and consequently,\nfairness is not a relevant problem in terms of computer engineering.

Specifically, PeepLoc works on any mobile device\nwith an unmodified Wi-Fi transceiver and in any indoor environment with a\nsufficient number of Wi-Fi access points (APs) and pedestrian traffic. At the\ncore of PeepLoc is (a) a mechanism which allows any Wi-Fi device to obtain\nnon-cooperative time-of-flight (ToF) to any Wi-Fi AP and (b) a novel\nbootstrapping mechanism that relies on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and\ncrowdsourcing to opportunistically initialize pre-existing APs as anchor points\nwithin an environment. We implement PeepLoc using commodity hardware and\nevaluate it extensively across 4 campus buildings. We show PeepLoc leads to a\nmean and median positional error of 3.41 m and 3.06 m respectively, which is\nsuperior to existing deployed indoor localization systems and is competitive\nwith commodity GPS in outdoor environments.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.HC", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18317v1"}

Blockchains are distributed\nsystems that order and timestamp records of a given network of users, in a\npublic, cryptographically secure, and consensual way. The records, which may in\nkind be events, transaction orders, sets of rules for structured transactions\netc. are placed within well-defined datastructures called blocks, and they are\nlinked to each other by the virtue of cryptographic pointers, in a total\nordering which represents their temporal relations of succession. The ability\nto operate on the blockchain, and/or to contribute a record to the content of a\nblock are shared resources of the blockchain systems. In commercial networks,\nthese resources are exchanged in return for fiat money, and consequently,\nfairness is not a relevant problem in terms of computer engineering. In\nnon-commercial networks, however, monetary solutions are not available, by\ndefinition. The present non-commercial blockchain networks employ trivial\ndistribution mechanisms called faucets, which offer fixed amounts of free\ntokens (called cryptocurrencies) specific to the given network. This mechanism,\nalthough simple and efficient, is prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks and\ncannot address the fairness problem. In the present dissertation, the faucet\nmechanism is adapted for fair distribution, in line with Max-min Fairness\nscheme. In total, we contributed 6 distinct Max-min Fair algorithms as\nefficient blockchain faucets.

In this\npaper, we propose a Physics-informed Neural Network framework to directly learn\na macroscopic non-local flow model from a generic looking-ahead looking-behind\nvehicle motion model, which bridges the micro-macro modeling gap. We\nreconstruct macroscopic traffic states from synthetic CAV trajectories\ngenerated by the proposed microscopic control designs, and then learn a\nnon-local traffic flow model that embeds a non-local conservation law to\ncapture the resulting look-ahead look-behind dynamics. To analyze how CAV\ncontrol parameters affect nonlocal traffic flow, we conduct high-fidelity\ndriving simulator experiments to collect human drivers' trajectory data with\nvarying downstream and upstream visibility, which serves as a baseline for\ntuning CAV control gains. Our analysis validates that the learned non-local\nflow model predicts CAV traffic dynamics more accurately than local models, and\nthe fundamental diagram exhibits far less scatter in the speed - density\nrelation. We further show that the looking-ahead/looking-behind control gains\nmainly reshape the non-local kernels, while the macroscopic speed and non-local\ndensity relation mainly depends on the desired speed function choice of the CAV\ncontroller. Our results provide a systematic approach for learning non-local\nmacroscopic traffic-flow models directly from generic CAV control designs.", "comment": null, "cate": "eess.SY", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18357v1"}

To achieve the\ngoal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework\nthat learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise\ncan trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level\nperturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic\nembedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To\nimprove stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes\nthe difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring\nthe attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can\neffectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned\nnoise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples\ncan reveal forgotten content in unseen images.

An AIR mechanism allows those who interact\nwith a specific, deployed (AI) system to report when they feel that they may\nhave experienced something problematic; these reports are then aggregated over\ntime, with the goal of evaluating the relevant system in a fine-grained manner.\nThis position paper argues that individual experiences should be understood as\nan integral part of post-deployment evaluation, and that the scope of our\nproposed aggregated individual reporting mechanism is a practical path to that\nend.

However, these labeled\nsupport samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity\ncomparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space\nitself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a\nseries of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning\nmethods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning\n(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and\nAugmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT).

In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'.

Machine\nlearning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.\nHowever, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose\nlevels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.\nAdditionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be\nexplainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine\nlearning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated\nagainst established medical literature, reducing confidence in their\nreliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that\npredict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and\nlifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.\nImportantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential\nmodel features and validate them against established medical literature. Our\nresults show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features\nand established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.\nCritically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,\nindicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for\nchronic disease prediction.

The effect of power\ncoupling means that any change in the inverter's active power will affect the\nreactive power and vice versa.

Prior\nstudies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn\nidentity features implicitly.

Our experiments confirm\nthat identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations\npreserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm\ngeneralization.

To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both\ndancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and\nadopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages.

Ground based tracking requires setting up\ninfrastructure, could be range limited, and may not be feasible in remote\nareas, crowded cities or in dense vegetation areas. Vision based active\ntracking of aerial objects from another airborne vehicle, e.g., a chaser\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), promises to fill this important gap, along with\nserving aerial coordination use cases. Vision-based active tracking by a UAV\nentails solving two coupled problems: 1) compute-efficient and accurate\n(target) object detection and target state estimation; and 2) maneuver\ndecisions to ensure that the target remains in the field of view in the future\ntime-steps and favorably positioned for continued detection. As a solution to\nthe first problem, this paper presents a novel integration of standard deep\nlearning based architectures with Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) to\nachieve compute-efficient object detection without compromising accuracy,\nunlike standalone learning or filtering approaches. The proposed perception\nframework is validated using a lab-scale setup. For the second problem, to\nobviate the linearity assumptions and background variations limiting\neffectiveness of the traditional controllers, we present the use of\nreinforcement learning to train a neuro-controller for fast computation of\nvelocity maneuvers. New state space, action space and reward formulations are\ndeveloped for this purpose, and training is performed in simulation using\nAirSim. The trained model is also tested in AirSim with respect to complex\ntarget maneuvers, and is found to outperform a baseline PID control in terms of\ntracking up-time and average distance maintained (from the target) during\ntracking.", "comment": "AIAA Aviation 2025", "cate": "cs.RO", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18264v1"}

Metric-based models typically operate by computing\nsimilarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric\nspace, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled\nsupport samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity\ncomparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space\nitself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a\nseries of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning\nmethods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning\n(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and\nAugmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT).

To address this, we propose a single-pass,\ntraining-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled\nrEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that\nhallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal\nrepresentations of input context and its generated output.

A promising solution is Human-AI teaming\n(HAT), which combines human expertise with AI's computational capabilities.\nLearning to Defer (L2D) operationalises HAT by enabling AI to \"defer\" uncertain\nor unfamiliar cases to human experts. However, traditional L2D models rely on\nstatic deferral policies that do not evolve with experience, limiting their\nability to learn from human feedback and adapt over time. To overcome this, we\nintroduce Learning to Defer with Human Feedback (L2DHF), an adaptive deferral\nframework that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\n(DRLHF) to optimise deferral decisions.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate.

The problem studied belongs to the\ncomputationally challenging class of WJCC with left-hand-side uncertainty\n(LHS-WJCC). By exploiting the special one-dimensional structure (even if only\npartially present) of the problem, the proposed FICA incorporates a set of\nstrong valid inequalities to accelerate the solution process. We prove that\nFICA achieves the same optimality as the well-known conditional value-at-risk\n(CVaR) inner convex approximation method. Our numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed FICA can yield 40x computational speedup compared to CVaR,\nand can even reach up to 500x speedup when the optimisation horizon exceeds 16\ntime steps. This speedup is achieved when only 50% of constraints in a WJCC\nhave the one-dimensional structure. The approximation quality is numerically\nverified to be the same as CVaR, and the quality gap is below 1% when compared\nto the computationally demanding exact reformulation of the LHS-WJCC in most\ncases.

However, most prior works in shape servoing\nrely on impractical goal shape acquisition methods, such as laborious\ndomain-knowledge engineering or manual manipulation. DefGoalNet previously\nposed the current state-of-the-art solution to this problem, which learns\ndeformable object goal shapes directly from a small number of human\ndemonstrations. However, it significantly struggles in multi-modal settings,\nwhere multiple distinct goal shapes can all lead to successful task completion.\nAs a deterministic model, DefGoalNet collapses these possibilities into a\nsingle averaged solution, often resulting in an unusable goal. In this paper,\nwe address this problem by developing DefFusionNet, a novel neural network that\nleverages the diffusion probabilistic model to learn a distribution over all\nvalid goal shapes rather than predicting a single deterministic outcome. This\nenables the generation of diverse goal shapes and avoids the averaging\nartifacts. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on robotic tasks inspired\nby both manufacturing and surgical applications, both in simulation and on a\nphysical robot. Our work is the first generative model capable of producing a\ndiverse, multi-modal set of deformable object goals for real-world robotic\napplications.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.RO", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18779v1"}

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL\nphenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend\nin the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.\nOverall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL\ngrounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.", "comment": "Preprint", "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17859v1"}

To achieve the\ngoal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework\nthat learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise\ncan trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level\nperturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic\nembedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To\nimprove stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes\nthe difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring\nthe attack is semantically unnoticeable.

Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best.

Specifically, in the first\nstage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the\nsecond stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected\nframes with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better\npredict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal\ninformation at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization\nperformance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level\npseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)\nmodule, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high\nquality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of\nsequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to\none specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive\nTemporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks\ncalled Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate\nCASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used\nas two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo\nlabels in turn.

These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches.

While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers\nsignificantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher\nmodel tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision\nfor tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation\n(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by\nreformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and\nintra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction\ndistributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),\nrespectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources\nof teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group\nloss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform\nintra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during\ndistillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and\nImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,\nachieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class\nperformance.

In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in\nhyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.\nOur approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections\nand curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an\nappropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition\nscheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of\npair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a\nnovel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models\ndirectly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming\nreasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows\nfor the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,\nconfidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals\nwithin its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,\nimplemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into\nlogical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine\nadaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal\nreasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces\nenables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing\norganizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and\nextraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of\nPyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.\nThis integration finds utility across numerous domains, including\nmanufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17776v1"}

Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

Since neural\nmachine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their\nconvergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the\nfunctional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to\nmodel human memory. Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine\ntranslation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both\ninterpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning.

Among these methods, domain generalization\napproaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault\nfeatures. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial.

Kamrul Hossain", "Walid Aljoby", "Anis Elgabli", "Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem", "Khaled A. Harras"], "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without exposing\nclients' data. While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,\nstudies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these\nupdates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during\ntransmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where\nadversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,\nconstituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random\nselection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL\nperformance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which\nsimultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and\nrobust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL\nimplements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The\nfirst framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual\ntrust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework\nhandles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.\nFor the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)\nenforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a\ncluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to\nprioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a\ntwo-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients\nbased on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)\nensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to\nreduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve\nenergy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\\times$ faster time-to-accuracy\nand up to $1.06\\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.", "comment": "17 pages", "cate": "cs.CR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17805v1"}

The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs.

In order to fill the blank, we\npropose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the\nreasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually\ndesigned or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the\nreasoning process.

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions.

Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to\nquantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static\nneuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a\nC++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across\nprompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably\nbiases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe\nclassification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe\nclassification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For\nLLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted\ninjections at key layers still improve language selection.

To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel\nbenchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors\nwithin a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the\nAI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging\ncutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -\nSilhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against\ndistribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased\nfeatures enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based\nMIL classifiers.", "comment": "Accepeted for oral presentation at Medical Image Understanding and\n  Analysis (MIUA) 2025", "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18668v1"}

The unit cost of an LLM is\nthe computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in\nthe efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the\nnumber of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular\napplications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation\nis that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the\ntokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most\nlikely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that\nimmediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing\ntokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for\ndifferent tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot\nconversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in\nthis domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers\nconsistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead\nto meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or\neven slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original\ntraining corpus.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CL", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18674v1"}

Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on\n''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic\nlong-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT\ndata, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and\nconsistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In\nthis work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely\nfrom scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages\nreinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality\ntext generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a\nbase model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that\nfacilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support\nthis, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved\nlength control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental\nevaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,\nconsistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,\nachieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and\nArena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and\nQwen3-235B.

To address this, we propose Commutative\nVector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for\nlong-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a\nlightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded\nvia simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during\ndecoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position\nEmbedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.\nThis enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention\nmechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and\nlow overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook.
