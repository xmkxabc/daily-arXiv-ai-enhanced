To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test\ncode fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case.\nOur method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution\ntrace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely\ninvolved in the failure.

Specifically, we represent the global map as a\ndepth map and leverage raw depth information to formulate a non-linear least\nsquares optimisation that jointly estimates poses of point clouds and the\nglobal map. Unlike traditional feature-based bundle adjustment methods, which\nrely on explicit feature extraction and data association, our method bypasses\nthese challenges by associating multi-frame point clouds with a global depth\nmap through their corresponding poses. This data association is implicitly\nincorporated and dynamically refined during the optimisation process. Extensive\nevaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches in accuracy, particularly in challenging\nenvironments where feature extraction and data association are difficult.", "comment": "8 pages, accepted for publication in IEEE/RSJ International\n  Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)", "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18922v1"}

Two communication topologies are considered,\nfull connectivity between each agent and the leader, and partial connectivity\nwherein agents rely on both neighboring peers and the leader.

With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball\ngraphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary\nconference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to\ndetermine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single\nvertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an\nefficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a\nlocation which maximizes the reliability.

It is a natural\ngeneralization of the classical proper coloring, in which each color must\ninstead induce an independent set. Similarly to proper coloring, we define the\nsubchromatic number of a graph as the minimum integer k such that it admits a\nsubcoloring with k colors, and the corresponding problem k-Subcoloring which\nasks whether a graph has subchromatic number at most k. In this paper, we\ninitiate the study of the subcoloring of (unit) disk graphs. One motivation\nstems from the fact that disk graphs can be seen as a dense generalization of\nplanar graphs where, intuitively, each vertex can be blown into a large\nclique--much like subcoloring generalizes proper coloring. Interestingly, it\ncan be observed that every unit disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most 7\ncolors. We first prove that the subchromatic number can be 3-approximated in\npolynomial-time in unit disk graphs. We then present several hardness results\nfor special cases of unit disk graphs which somehow prevents the use of\nclassical approaches for improving this result. We show in particular that\n2-subcoloring remains NP-hard in triangle-free unit disk graphs, as well as in\nunit disk graphs representable within a strip of bounded height. We also solve\nan open question of Broersma, Fomin, Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il, and Woeginger (2002) by\nproving that 3-Subcoloring remains NP-hard in co-comparability graphs. Finally,\nwe prove that every $n$-vertex disk graph admits a subcoloring with at most\n$O(\\log^3(n))$ colors and present a $O(\\log^2(n))$-approximation algorithm for\ncomputing the subchromatic number of such graphs.

However, it\nis fundamentally constrained by the capability to model the target code\nincluding library functions in terms of symbolic constraint and the capability\nof underlying constraint solvers. As a result, many paths involving complex\nfeatures remain unanalyzed or insufficiently modeled. Recent advances in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating diverse and valid test\ninputs. Yet, LLMs lack mechanisms for systematically enumerating program paths\nand often fail to cover subtle corner cases. We observe that directly prompting\nan LLM with the full program leads to missed coverage of interesting paths. In\nthis paper, we present PALM, a test generation system that combines symbolic\npath enumeration with LLM-assisted test generation. PALM statically enumerates\npossible paths through AST-level analysis and transforms each into an\nexecutable variant with embedded assertions that specify the target path. This\navoids the need to translate path constraints into SMT formulae, by instead\nconstructing program variants that LLM can interpret. Importantly, PALM is the\nfirst to provide an interactive frontend that visualizes path coverage\nalongside generated tests, assembling tests based on the specific paths they\nexercise. A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that PALM's frontend\nhelps users better understand path coverage and identify which paths are\nactually exercised by PALM-generated tests, through verification and\nvisualization of their path profiles.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.SE", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19287v1"}

In the real\nworld, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with\nthe same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same\npatterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation\npreference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.\nDiffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great\nsuccess in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and\nrepresent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of\nadaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,\nwe use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the\ndiversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model\nbased on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the\noriginal distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition\nmodel, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse\nreconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is\ncompleted by injecting multi-interests representational information that\neliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In\nthe inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition\nby using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to\nreconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments\non three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on\naccuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes\nthe degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.IR", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19777v1"}

This\nwork aims to develop a novel numerical approach that overcomes these\nlimitations by enabling accurate stress prediction with improved flexibility\nfor complex geometries and boundary conditions and fewer degrees of freedom\n(DOFs). The proposed method is based on a spline-based stress function\nformulation for the principle of minimum complementary energy, which we apply\nto plane, linear elastostatics. The method is first validated against an\nanalytical power series solution and then tested on two test cases challenging\nfor current state-of-the-art numerical schemes, a bi-layer cantilever with\nanisotropic material behavior, and a cantilever with a non-prismatic,\nparabolic-shaped beam geometry. Results demonstrate that our approach, unlike\nanalytical methods, can be easily applied to general geometries and boundary\nconditions, and achieves stress accuracy comparable to that reported in the\nliterature for displacement-based FEMs, while requiring significantly fewer\nDOFs. This novel spline-based stress function approach thus provides an\nefficient and flexible tool for accurate stress prediction, with promising\napplications in structural analysis and numerical design.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CE", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19534v1"}

Unlike\ntraditional bits, each of which is independently treated, the semantics of each\ntoken depends on its surrounding context tokens. This inter-token dependency\nmakes TC vulnerable to outage channels, where the loss of a single token can\nsignificantly distort the original message semantics. Motivated by this, this\npaper focuses on optimizing token packetization to maximize the average token\nsimilarity (ATS) between the original and received token messages under outage\nchannels. Due to inter-token dependency, this token grouping problem is\ncombinatorial, with complexity growing exponentially with message length. To\naddress this, we propose a novel framework of semantic packet aggregation with\nlookahead search (SemPA-Look), built on two core ideas. First, it introduces\nthe residual semantic score (RSS) as a token-level surrogate for the\nmessage-level ATS, allowing robust semantic preservation even when a certain\ntoken packet is lost. Second, instead of full search, SemPA-Look applies a\nlookahead search-inspired algorithm that samples intra-packet token candidates\nwithout replacement (fixed depth), conditioned on inter-packet token candidates\nsampled with replacement (fixed width), thereby achieving linear complexity.\nExperiments on a remote AIGC task with the MS-COCO dataset (text captioned\nimages) demonstrate that SemPA-Look achieves high ATS and LPIPS scores\ncomparable to exhaustive search, while reducing computational complexity by up\nto 40$\\times$.

This study investigates how\nsituational emotional cues influence the perception and interpretation of\nhaptic signals given by a robot. In a controlled experiment, 32 participants\nwatched video scenarios in which a robot experienced either positive actions\n(such as being kissed), negative actions (such as being slapped) or neutral\nactions. After each video, the robot conveyed its emotional response through\nhaptic communication, delivered via a wearable vibration sleeve worn by the\nparticipant. Participants rated the robot's emotional state-its valence\n(positive or negative) and arousal (intensity)-based on the video, the haptic\nfeedback, and the combination of the two. The study reveals a dynamic interplay\nbetween visual context and touch. Participants' interpretation of haptic\nfeedback was strongly shaped by the emotional context of the video, with visual\ncontext often overriding the perceived valence of the haptic signal. Negative\nhaptic cues amplified the perceived valence of the interaction, while positive\ncues softened it. Furthermore, haptics override the participants' perception of\narousal of the video.

While reinforcement learning (RL) can\nalleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it\ntypically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which\nhinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous\nmanipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These\ntrajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL\npolicies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However,\nsourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a\nsignificant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference\ntrajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our\nkey insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the\ncommonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide\nexploration effectively.

Nowadays, agents are undergoing a new\nround of evolution.

Under this\ntrend, agent communication is regarded as a foundational pillar of the future\nAI ecosystem, and many organizations intensively begin to design related\ncommunication protocols (e.g., Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A) within the\nrecent few months. However, this new field exposes significant security hazard,\nwhich can cause severe damage to real-world scenarios. To help researchers to\nquickly figure out this promising topic and benefit the future agent\ncommunication development, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of agent\ncommunication security. More precisely, we first present a clear definition of\nagent communication and categorize the entire lifecyle of agent communication\ninto three stages: user-agent interaction, agent-agent communication, and\nagent-environment communication. Next, for each communication phase, we dissect\nrelated protocols and analyze its security risks according to the communication\ncharacteristics.

While it is\ncommon practice for practitioners to develop their own, custom, non-portable\nbinary formats for high-performance sparse matrix storage, there is currently\nno cross-platform binary sparse matrix storage format.

This study evaluates\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art Aurora foundation model in predicting\nhydrological variables, which were not considered during pretraining. We\nintroduce a lightweight approach using shallow decoders trained on the latent\nrepresentations of the pretrained model to predict these new variables.

The decoder-based approach requires 50% less training time\nand 35% less memory, while achieving strong accuracy across various\nhydrological variables and preserving desirable properties of the foundation\nmodel, such as autoregressive stability. Notably, decoder accuracy depends on\nthe physical correlation between the new variables and those used during\npretraining, indicating that Aurora's latent space captures meaningful physical\nrelationships.

Next,\nwe numerically implement this transformer and demonstrate in experiments the\nexact correspondence between our architecture and Lloyd's algorithm, providing\na fully neural implementation of $k$-means clustering. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat interpretable alterations (e.g., incorporating layer normalizations or\nmultilayer perceptrons) to this architecture yields diverse and novel variants\nof clustering algorithms, such as soft $k$-means, spherical $k$-means, trimmed\n$k$-means, and more.

To\nmitigate the influence of these disturbance models on control, we propose a\ncontrol method that combines dynamic inverse and disturbance models, ensuring\nconsistent control effectiveness at both high and low altitudes. In this\nmethod, the additional thrust and variations in rotor drag under ground effect\nare both considered and compensated through feedforward models. The leveling\ntorque of ground effect can be equivalently represented as variations in the\ncenter of gravity and the moment of inertia. In this way, the leveling torque\ndoes not explicitly appear in the dynamic model.

Firstly, given that unlike in speech or music, stimulus F0 of FFRs\nis already known, we introduce a stimulus-aware filterbank that selectively\naggregates amplitudes at F0 and its harmonics while suppressing noise at\nnon-harmonic frequencies. This method, called Harmonic Amplitude Summation\n(HAS), evaluates F0 candidates only within a range centered around the stimulus\nF0.

Carvalho", "André Freitas"], "summary": "Incorporating explicit reasoning rules within the latent space of language\nmodels (LMs) offers a promising pathway to enhance generalisation,\ninterpretability, and controllability. While current Transformer-based language\nmodels have shown strong performance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks,\nthey often rely on memorisation rather than rule-based inference. This work\ninvestigates how reasoning rules can be explicitly embedded and memorised\nwithin the LMs through Language Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a\ncomplete pipeline for learning reasoning rules within Transformer-based\nlanguage VAEs. This pipeline encompasses three rule-based reasoning tasks, a\nsupporting theoretical framework, and a practical end-to-end architecture. The\nexperiment illustrates the following findings: Disentangled reasoning: Under\nexplicit signal supervision, reasoning rules - viewed as functional mappings -\ncan be disentangled within the encoder's parametric space. This separation\nresults in distinct clustering of rules in the output feature space. Prior\nknowledge injection: injecting reasoning information into the Query enables the\nmodel to more effectively retrieve the stored value Value from memory based on\nKey. This approach offers a simple method for integrating prior knowledge into\ndecoder-only language models. Performance bottleneck: In mathematical reasoning\ntasks using Qwen2.5(0.5B), increasing sample count doesn't improve performance\nbeyond a point. Moreover, ffn layers are better than attention layers at\npreserving the separation of reasoning rules in the model's parameters.", "comment": null, "cate": "cs.CL", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19418v1"}

This capability is not well captured by\nstandard reinforcement learning algorithms that rely on incremental value\nupdates. Rapid adaptation likely depends on episodic memory -- the ability to\nretrieve specific past experiences to guide decisions in novel contexts.\nTransformers provide a useful setting for studying these questions because of\ntheir ability to learn rapidly in-context and because their key-value\narchitecture resembles episodic memory systems in the brain. We train a\ntransformer to in-context reinforcement learn in a distribution of planning\ntasks inspired by rodent behavior. We then characterize the learning algorithms\nthat emerge in the model. We first find that representation learning is\nsupported by in-context structure learning and cross-context alignment, where\nrepresentations are aligned across environments with different sensory stimuli.\nWe next demonstrate that the reinforcement learning strategies developed by the\nmodel are not interpretable as standard model-free or model-based planning.\nInstead, we show that in-context reinforcement learning is supported by caching\nintermediate computations within the model's memory tokens, which are then\naccessed at decision time. Overall, we find that memory may serve as a\ncomputational resource, storing both raw experience and cached computations to\nsupport flexible behavior. Furthermore, the representations developed in the\nmodel resemble computations associated with the hippocampal-entorhinal system\nin the brain, suggesting that our findings may be relevant for natural\ncognition.

To prevent performance degradation from algorithm updates, SC\ndevelopers must evaluate diagnostic performance changes for individual diseases\nbefore deployment. However, acquiring sufficient evaluation data for rare\ndiseases is difficult, and manually creating numerous clinical vignettes is\ncostly and impractical. Objective: This study proposes and validates a novel\nSynthetic Vignette Simulation Approach to evaluate diagnostic performance\nchanges for individual rare diseases following SC algorithm updates. Methods:\nWe used disease-phenotype annotations from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO),\na knowledge database for rare diseases, to generate synthetic vignettes. With\nthese, we simulated SC interviews to estimate the impact of algorithm updates\non real-world diagnostic performance. The method's effectiveness was evaluated\nretrospectively by comparing estimated values with actual metric changes using\nthe R 2(R-squared) coefficient. Results: The experiment included eight past SC\nalgorithm updates. For updates on diseases with frequency information in HPO\n(n=5), the R^2 for recall@8 change was 0.831 (p=0.031), and for precision@8\nchange, it was 0.78 (p=0.047), indicating the method can predict\npost-deployment performance. In contrast, large prediction errors occurred for\ndiseases without frequency information (n=3), highlighting its importance. The\nmanual effort to map HPO phenotypes to SC symptoms was approximately 2 hours\nper disease. Conclusions: Our method enables pre-deployment evaluation of SC\nalgorithm changes for individual rare diseases using a publicly available,\nexpert-created knowledge base.

This multi-stage\napproach enables precise, automated calculation of per vehicle carbon\nemissions. Extensive evaluation was conducted using a diverse vehicle dataset\nenriched with segmentation masks and annotated license plates. The YOLOv8\ndetector achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of approximately 71% for\nbounding boxes and 70% for segmentation masks. Character level OCR accuracy\nreached up to 99% with the best performing CNN model.

To\naddress these limitations, we propose DiffRIS, a novel framework that harnesses\nthe semantic understanding capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion\nmodels for enhanced cross-modal alignment in RRSIS tasks. Our framework\nintroduces two key innovations: a context perception adapter (CP-adapter) that\ndynamically refines linguistic features through global context modeling and\nobject-aware reasoning, and a progressive cross-modal reasoning decoder (PCMRD)\nthat iteratively aligns textual descriptions with visual regions for precise\nsegmentation. The CP-adapter bridges the domain gap between general\nvision-language understanding and remote sensing applications, while PCMRD\nenables fine-grained semantic alignment through multi-scale feature\ninteraction.

This\npaper introduces Noise Consistency Training (NCT), a novel and lightweight\napproach to directly integrate new control signals into pre-trained one-step\ngenerators without requiring access to original training images or retraining\nthe base diffusion model. NCT operates by introducing an adapter module and\nemploys a noise consistency loss in the noise space of the generator.

We propose GenHSI, a training-free method for controllable generation\nof long human-scene interaction videos (HSI). Taking inspiration from movie\nanimation, our key insight is to overcome the limitations of previous work by\nsubdividing the long video generation task into three stages: (1) script\nwriting, (2) pre-visualization, and (3) animation. Given an image of a scene, a\nuser description, and multiple images of a person, we use these three stages to\ngenerate long-videos that preserve human-identity and provide rich human-scene\ninteractions. Script writing converts complex human tasks into simple atomic\ntasks that are used in the pre-visualization stage to generate 3D keyframes\n(storyboards).

Yet, developing a precise\nunderstanding of how individual demonstrations contribute to downstream\noutcomes - such as closed-loop task success or failure - remains a persistent\nchallenge. We propose CUPID, a robot data curation method based on a novel\ninfluence function-theoretic formulation for imitation learning policies. Given\na set of evaluation rollouts, CUPID estimates the influence of each training\ndemonstration on the policy's expected return. This enables ranking and\nselection of demonstrations according to their impact on the policy's\nclosed-loop performance. We use CUPID to curate data by 1) filtering out\ntraining demonstrations that harm policy performance and 2) subselecting newly\ncollected trajectories that will most improve the policy. Extensive simulated\nand hardware experiments show that our approach consistently identifies which\ndata drives test-time performance. For example, training with less than 33% of\ncurated data can yield state-of-the-art diffusion policies on the simulated\nRoboMimic benchmark, with similar gains observed in hardware.

Aiming to alleviate\nthe impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a\nNormalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the\nmismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI)\nstrategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the\nglobal mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural\nnetwork exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster\nconvergence and enhanced reconstruction performance.

In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal\nEnergy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish\nas spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical\ndecay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we\npropose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with $O(n \\log\nn)$ complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute\ndensity, which is significantly more efficient than standard $O(n^2)$ dense\nattention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial\nAttention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to\nspatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal\ndistance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend\ntheir generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across\nWan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9$\\times$ speedup\nover the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video\ngeneration up to 4$\\times$ longer while reducing training costs by up to\n4.4$\\times$ compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to\n3.7$\\times$ compared to dense attention inference.", "comment": "Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/radial-attention", "cate": "cs.CV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19852v1"}
