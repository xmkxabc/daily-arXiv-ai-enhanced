Optimal scheduling requires up-to-date network state information\n(i.e., of channel occupancy) to select non-overlapping channels for links in\ninterference regions. However, state sharing among nodes introduces significant\ncommunication overhead, especially as network size or node mobility scale,\nthereby decreasing throughput efficiency of already capacity-limited networks.\nIn this paper, we eschew state sharing while adapting the CS schedule based on\na learning-based channel occupancy prediction. We propose the MiLAAP\nattention-based prediction framework for machine learning models of spectral,\nspatial, and temporal dependencies among network nodes. MiLAAP uses a\nself-attention mechanism that lets each node capture the temporospectral CS\npattern in its interference region and accordingly predict the channel\noccupancy state within that region.

In real-world crowd scenes, the vast majority of spatial regions\n(often over 95%) contain no people, leading to heavily imbalanced count\ndistributions. Ignoring this imbalance can bias models toward overestimating\ndense regions and underperforming in sparse areas. Furthermore, most loss\nfunctions used in density estimation are majorly based on MSE and implicitly\nassume Gaussian distributions, which are ill-suited for modeling discrete,\nnon-negative count data. In this paper, we propose EBC-ZIP, a crowd counting\nframework that models the spatial distribution of counts using a Zero-Inflated\nPoisson (ZIP) regression formulation. Our approach replaces the traditional\nregression loss with the negative log-likelihood of the ZIP distribution,\nenabling better handling of zero-heavy distributions while preserving count\naccuracy. Built upon the recently proposed Enhanced Block Classification (EBC)\nframework, EBC-ZIP inherits EBC's advantages in preserving the discreteness of\ntargets and ensuring training stability, while further improving performance\nthrough a more principled probabilistic loss.

However, learning-based methods often face challenges\nwith limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform\ncompared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While\niterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are\nconsiderably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations,\nwe propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines\nthe strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better\nbalance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement\nentropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each\nvoxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it\nintroduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy\nreceives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level\nimage pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential\ncomplexity growth.

An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines.

This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a\ndecoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or\nAO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard\nAO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from\nrefinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the\nlanguage's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural\ninfluences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that\nwhile encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,\ndecoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\\sim25\\times$) and\ncomparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly\nlarger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core\nparadigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for\nfuture model design.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive\nsystem-level study of post-quantum DNS security across three widely deployed\nmechanisms: DNSSEC, DNS-over-TLS (DoT), and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). We propose\nPost-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC)-DNS, a unified framework for benchmarking DNS\nsecurity under legacy, post-quantum, and hybrid cryptographic configurations.\nOur implementation leverages the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) libraries and\nintegrates lattice- and hash-based primitives into BIND9 and TLS 1.3 stacks. We\nformalize performance and threat models and analyze the impact of post-quantum\nkey encapsulation and digital signatures on end-to-end DNS resolution.\nExperimental results on a containerized testbed reveal that lattice-based\nprimitives such as Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (MLKEM) and\nFalcon offer practical latency and resource profiles, while hash-based schemes\nlike SPHINCS+ significantly increase message sizes and processing overhead. We\nalso examine security implications including downgrade risks, fragmentation\nvulnerabilities, and susceptibility to denial-of-service amplification.

Stain unmixing is a promising alternative that\nquantifies the amounts of dyes. In previous work, multispectral imaging was\nutilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain for quantitative\ndiagnosis. Still, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the\nnumber of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel\nPapanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images that incorporates three key\nassumptions: nonnegative stain abundances; a sparse spatial distribution of\nhematoxylin, which binds to nuclei; and piecewise smoothness of stain\nabundances. By formulating this as an optimization problem with nonnegativity,\nweighted nucleus sparsity, and total variation regularizations, our method\nachieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against\nthe results of multispectral imaging. We also adopted the proposed method for\ndiscriminating lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a\nprecancerous lesion of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The resulting\nquantification distinctly characterized differences between LEGH and normal\nendocervical cells with stain abundance, and a classifier based on the\nquantification results achieved 98.0% accuracy. This demonstrates the\nsignificant potential of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis.", "comment": "22 pages, 12 figures", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20450v1", "categories": ["eess.IV", "q-bio.QM"], "cate": "eess.IV", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20450v1"}

While recent\nsurgical foundation models pretrained on large-scale vision-language data offer\npromising transferability, their zero-shot performance remains constrained by\ndomain shifts, limiting their utility in unseen surgical environments. To\naddress this, we introduce Surgical Phase Anywhere (SPA), a lightweight\nframework for versatile surgical workflow understanding that adapts foundation\nmodels to institutional settings with minimal annotation. SPA leverages\nfew-shot spatial adaptation to align multi-modal embeddings with\ninstitution-specific surgical scenes and phases. It also ensures temporal\nconsistency through diffusion modeling, which encodes task-graph priors derived\nfrom institutional procedure protocols. Finally, SPA employs dynamic test-time\nadaptation, exploiting the mutual agreement between multi-modal phase\nprediction streams to adapt the model to a given test video in a\nself-supervised manner, enhancing the reliability under test-time distribution\nshifts. SPA is a lightweight adaptation framework, allowing hospitals to\nrapidly customize phase recognition models by defining phases in natural\nlanguage text, annotating a few images with the phase labels, and providing a\ntask graph defining phase transitions.

To address these issues, we propose tackling the\nregistration problem from the spectral domain.

In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL\ndynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our\nstudy reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as\nMegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance,\nwhile existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further\nadding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\nexamples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this\neffect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce\nverbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the\nimportance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to\nstronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a\ntwo-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are\nfirst trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B\ntokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields\nOctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and\nclosing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen.\nWe hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models\nin the RL era.

Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises\nwhen these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for\nwhich ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs.\nProviding recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under\nMM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e.,\nthe CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of\nproviding recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We\npropose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be\nconsidered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and\nrecourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six\ndesirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose\na novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs\nunder MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to\nexplicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding\nprediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to\nresolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is\nparametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the\nspecification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further\ncustomisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we\ncharacterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different\nargumentation semantics.

The recent generalization to Panoptic Scene\nCompletion (PSC) advances the SSC domain by integrating instance-level\ninformation, thereby enhancing object-level sensitivity in scene understanding.\nWhile PSC was introduced using LiDAR modality, methods based on camera images\nremain largely unexplored. Moreover, recent Transformer-based SSC approaches\nutilize a fixed set of learned queries to reconstruct objects within the scene\nvolume. Although these queries are typically updated with image context during\ntraining, they remain static at test time, limiting their ability to\ndynamically adapt specifically to the observed scene. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose IPFormer, the first approach that leverages\ncontext-adaptive instance proposals at train and test time to address\nvision-based 3D Panoptic Scene Completion. Specifically, IPFormer adaptively\ninitializes these queries as panoptic instance proposals derived from image\ncontext and further refines them through attention-based encoding and decoding\nto reason about semantic instance-voxel relationships.

Counterfactual\nself-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the\nmodel's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in\nthe training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be\naffected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in\nparticular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization\ntreating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into\naccount how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a\nsmall language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training\nsamples on each other and analyze its properties.

The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material\nproperties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method.\nWhile the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and\nenables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it\nfaces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to\nthe residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework\nintegrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical\nconsistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN\nachieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational\ncost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and\ndemonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20537v1", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "cate": "cs.LG", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20537v1"}

In practice, it is\noften challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of\ndemonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover,\nit is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve\nbeyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\nimitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration\n(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy\noptimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high\nuncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and\n(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the\ndemonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art\nimitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves\nbeyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations\nthan in previous work.

An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines.

We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type\nclassification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a\nmean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the\nSVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental\nnoise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data\n(mAP 0.35) are also discussed.

Therefore, the question of\nwhether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate\ndownstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction\nof principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in\nthe sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners\nfrom corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic\nRobust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures\nthat minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first\ninstantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber\nestimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness\nresult on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering\nprocedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a\nheterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared\nto the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually.\nWe explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem\nparameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data,\nobserving statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the\ntrade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific)\nprefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP\nfor large datasets.", "comment": null, "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20573v1", "categories": ["stat.ML", "cs.LG"], "cate": "stat.ML", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20573v1"}

Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand\nmotion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's\nend-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot\nmotion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted\nmotion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with\nplausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained\ngeneralist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows\nthe human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot\nactions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or\npaired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes\nwith minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.
